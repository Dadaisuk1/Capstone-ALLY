The penalty is reclusion perpetua for each count of rape. The victim is entitled to civil liability, moral damages, and exemplary damages of PHP 75,000.00 each per count. All damages earn 6% interest per annum from finality of decision until fully paid. However, for the relationship to be considered as a qualifying circumstance, it must be specifically alleged in the information - merely being a common-law stepfather without legal marriage cannot be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance unless properly alleged."
