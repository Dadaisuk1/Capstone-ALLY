"G.R. No. 239385, April 17, 2024 ","FLORDIVINA M. GASPAR,* PETITIONER, VS. M.I.Y. REAL ESTATE CORP.,** AND MELISSA ILAGAN YU, RESPONDENTS.","A Complaint[6] for illegal dismissal with money claims dated August 14, 2014 was filed by petitioner against M.I.Y. and Yu. Petitioner alleged (1) that she was a regular employee of M.I.Y.;[7] (2) that she was hired on April 10, 2013 as Facilities Maintenance and Services (FM&S) personnel at the Goldrich Mansion, where M.I.Y. conducted its business and Yu maintained a separate residence;[8] (3) as FM&S personnel, her duty was to monitor and maintain the orderliness and cleanliness of every floor of the building, including its establishments such as a spa, massage parlor, salon, bar, transient rooms, and agency (yaya.com);[9] (3) that she cleaned, mopped the floor, washed the glass windows of every floor, changed the bedsheets, pillows, and curtains of the transient rooms, and cleaned all the transient rooms;[10] (4) that she also maintained the things used in the spa and massage parlor, like changing the towels used, checking the provisions for face towels, uniforms, and accessories, and monitored the staff;[11] and (5) that she was also assigned to handle, monitor, and clean the penthouse where Yu's office was located.[12] In other words, petitioner performed her tasks as FM&S staff for M.I.Y. and Yu.

Petitioner further alleged that respondents crafted a policy to force her to end the contract with them every six months.[13] Petitioner was allegedly instructed to make a copy of a resignation letter given to her, then affix her name and signature.[14] Furthermore, she was instructed to take a two-week vacation, then return to work thereafter.[15] Petitioner also complained and reported to respondents that, by the negligence of another employee, her eyes were hit by a hot blower sprayed by the steamer in the spa, and that she did not receive any medication or medical help.[16]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) challenges the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 141835, which affirmed in toto the Decision[4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. 01-000260-15 (NLRC NCR Case No. 08-10199-14).

The CA held that the labor tribunal did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it declared that: (1) petitioner Flordivina M. Gaspar was not an employee of M.I.Y. Real Estate Corporation (M.I.Y.); and (2) petitioner was engaged as a domestic worker of Melissa Ilagan Yu (Yu) (collectively respondents).[5]","We rule in the negative and deny the Petition for lack of merit.

Petitioner did not establish with substantial evidence her employment with M.I.Y. Thus, the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction when it declared petitioner as a domestic worker of Yu and consequently affirmed the labor tribunals.

Judicial review of a labor case

Petitioner alleges that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction when it affirmed the finding that she was a domestic worker of Yu, and not an employee of M.I.Y.[64]

We disagree.

The decision of the NLRC may be reviewed by the CA through a Rule 65 petition when there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction.[65]

Grave abuse of discretion is defined in jurisprudence as such capricious and arbitrary exercise of judgment as equivalent, in the eyes of the law, to lack of jurisdiction.[66] There is grave abuse of discretion where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of a positive duty, or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or to act at all in contemplation of law.[67] Through time, the meaning of grave abuse of discretion has been expanded to include any action done contrary to the Constitution, the law, or jurisprudence.[68]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The April 26, 2017 Decision and the October 11, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 141835 are AFFIRMED."

Direct resort to the Court is allowed following the guidelines set forth in In Re: Elbanbuena[54]
 

As a general rule, litigants must observe the hierarchy of courts.[55] Direct resort to this Court is justified only when there are special and important reasons specifically set out in the petition.[56]

In Hernan v. Sandiganbayan,[57] We ruled that the passage of Republic Act No. 10951 is an exceptional circumstance which warrants not only the re­opening of an already terminated case, but also the recall of an Entry of Judgment for purposes of modifying the penalty to be served. Hernan sought only the modification of sentence pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951.

In contrast and applying Hernan, the case of In Re: Elbanbuena[58] involved the modification of sentence pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951, as well as the immediate release from confinement on account of full service of the re­computed sentence.

The Court in In Re: Elbanbuena then issued guidelines to govern the procedures for actions seeking the following reliefs: (1) the modification, based on the amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 10951, of penalties imposed by final judgments; and (2) the immediate release of the petitioner­convict on account of full service of the penalty/penalties, as modified.[59] Among others, We laid down the rule on direct resort to this Court:
VII. Judgment of the court.

To avoid any prolonged imprisonment, the court shall promulgate judgment no later than ten (10) calendar days after the lapse of the period to file comment. The judgment shall set forth the following:
The penalty/penalties imposable in accordance with RA No. 10951;
Where proper, the length of time the petitioner-convict has been in confinement (and whether time allowance for good conduct should be allowed); and
Whether the petitioner-convict is entitled to immediate release due to complete service of his sentence/s, as modified in accordance with RA No. 10951.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 254186, April 17, 2024","SOLITO C. AMORES, JR., PETITIONER, VS. GOLDROUTE MARITIME INC., RESPONDENT.","On March 28, 2015, petitioner entered into a Contract of Employment[5] with Goldroute Maritime Inc. on behalf of its principal, Kyowa Kisen Co. Ltd., to work as an oiler on board the vessel ""Kanoura"" for a period of nine months. Petitioner was declared fit for sea duty upon undergoing the mandatory pre-­employment medical examination (PEME).[6]

During the effectivity of his contract, or sometime in October 2015, petitioner experienced chest pains and shortness of breath. Before he can even report his medical condition to the ship Captain, the latter informed him that he would be sent home. When petitioner inquired as to the reason for his repatriation prior to the expiration of his contract, the Captain merely told him that it was respondent company's order to send him home. On October 18, 2015, petitioner, along with two other seafarers, was repatriated to the Philippines.[7]

On October 19, 2015, petitioner immediately reported to respondent's office where he was informed that he will be transferred to another vessel and to wait for advice regarding his next deployment. Petitioner requested for a post-­employment medical examination as he was still experiencing intermittent chest pains but he was told to see his own private doctor.[8] Thus, on October 20, 2015, petitioner consulted with Dr. Rogelio M. Ramirez (Dr. Ramirez) who prescribed some medications for his chest pains and advised him to undergo further medical examinations such as electrocardiogram and treadmill stress test.[9]

On December 5, 2015, respondent informed petitioner of his line up for deployment and advised him to undergo PEME. On December 15, 2015, petitioner was examined by respondent's company-designated physician, Dr. Ramon M. Guzman (Dr. Guzman). After laboratory tests and physical examination, petitioner was found to be suffering from Hypertension, Controlled, T/C Ischemic Heart for Work-Up and Possible Angiography. Consequently, petitioner was declared unfit for sea duty.[10]

On December 28, 2016, petitioner underwent cardiovascular evaluation at the PMP Diagnostic Center, Inc. Dr. Ana Ma. Luisa Javier (Dr. Javier), the company-designated Cardiologist who examined petitioner made the following findings:
ASSESSMENT: Hypertensive cardiovascular disease to rule out Atherosclerotic Heart Disease","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 146946. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision[4] of the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators which granted the claim of petitioner Solito C. Amores, Jr. for total and permanent disability benefits.","We rule in the negative.

Petitioner chiefly argues that respondent's failure to provide him with the mandatory post-employment examination resulted in his entitlement to total and permanent disability benefits by operation of law. On the other hand, respondent belies petitioner's claim that he reported his medical condition to respondent immediately upon his repatriation and that he asked to be referred to the company-designated physician for post-employment examination.

The question under consideration is evidently factual because it requires an examination of the evidence on record and a determination of whether or not petitioner indeed asked for a post-employment medical examination from respondent after his repatriation. Well-settled is the rule that the Court is not a trier of facts. The function of the Court in petitions for review on certiorari is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts.[38]

However, this rule is not absolute and admits of exceptions like in labor cases where the Court may look into factual issues when the factual findings of the lower tribunals are conflicting.[39] In this case, the findings of the PVA are contrary to those of the CA. They had a different appreciation of the evidence in determining the propriety of petitioner's claim for disability benefits. To finally resolve the factual dispute, the Court deems it proper to tackle the factual question presented.[40]

Petitioner, insists that respondent refused to subject him to a post-­employment medical examination which resulted to a lack of proper medical assessment thereby rendering him totally and permanently disabled by operation of law.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The September 4, 2019 Decision and the November 3, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R.

Amores, Jr. for total and permanent disability benefits, are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 254433, April 17, 2024","ARLO ALUMINUM CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc. (Arlo), a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines,[4] filed an Application[5] dated June 21, 2012 for the registration of title over Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947 located in Barangay Caniogan, Pasig City. Arlo claimed to have acquired Lot No. 7948, a parcel of land measuring about 62.50 square meters, sometime in 1996 from Melvin Atienza (Atienza). Atienza bought the said lot from Esmeraldo Tambongco (Tambongco), who had been in continuous, uninterrupted, open, public, and adverse possession, and in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945, or possibly earlier. Arlo further alleged that it acquired the adjacent land, Lot No. 7947, measuring approximately 146.94 square meters, from Dalisay Crisostomo (Crisostomo). Crisostomo likewise acquired the same from Tambongco, who had been in continuous, uninterrupted, open, public, and adverse possession, and in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945, or possibly earlier. Arlo claimed that Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947 have been declared for taxation purposes, and the realty taxes thereon have been paid.[6]

The Office of Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Notice of Appearance[7] dated January 23, 2013 and a letter[8] deputizing the Office of the City Prosecutor of Pasig City to appear in the case before the trial court.

During the course of the proceedings, Arlo submitted the following documents: (1) Notice of Initial Hearing;[9] (2) Affidavit of Publication;[10] (3) Official Gazette;[11] (4) Technical Description of Lot No. 7948;[12] (5) Tax Declaration No,. 007-07150 for Lot No. 7948;[13] (6) Real Property Tax Clearance No. A-3 1269 for Lot No. 7948;[14] (7) Tax Declaration No. 007-05478 for Lot No. 7947;[15] (8) Real Property Tax Clearance No. A-3 1268 for Lot No. 7947;[16] (9) Technical Description of Lot No. 7947;[17] (10) Survey Plan for Lot No. 7948;[18] and (11) Survey Plan for Lot No. 7947.[19]

Arlo also submitted two Certifications dated September 27, 2013 issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR), which were signed by Regional Executive Director Neria A. Andin, Ceso III (Andin), indicating that Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947, containing an area of 47 square meters and 165 square meters, respectively, as surveyed by Geodetic Engineer Florante S. Abad, were verified to be within the alienable or disposable land under Project No. 21 of Pasig per Land Classification (LC) Map No. 639, approved on March 11, 1927.[20]
","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112019.","In view of new legal and jurisprudential developments during the pendency of this case, the Court resolves to remand the matter to the appellate court for the reception of new evidence.

Generally, the Supreme Court does not review the factual findings of the CA since this Court is not a trier of facts. It will not rule on questions of fact, as the factual findings of the appellate courts are deemed final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and upon the Court, provided they are supported by substantial evidence.[46] However, there are exceptional circumstances when the Court is called to deal with questions of fact in resolving a petition for review on certiorari, such as:
(1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are co1iflicting; (6) when the [CA], in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both [parties]; (7) when the finding of the [CA] are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) when the finding of fact of the [CA] is premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.

These exceptions similarly apply in petitions for review filed before this court involving civil, labor, tax, or criminal cases.

A question of fact requires this court to review the truthfulness or falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes assessment of the ""probative value of the evidence presented."" There is also a question of fact when the issue presented before this court is the correctness of the lower courts' appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties.[47] (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, the determination of whether Arlo sufficiently established that the subject lots are alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, as well as its possession and occupation of the said lots under a bona fide claim of ownership, is a factual question that requires a review of the evidence on record. Since the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court, the instant case falls under the well-recognized exceptions. ","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is DENIED in part. The Decision dated February 7, 2020 and the Resolution dated November 20, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112019 are hereby SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals, for reception of evidence on the following matters based on the parameters set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act No. 11573:
The area covered by Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947;
The nature, period and circumstances of the possession and occupation of Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc. and its predecessors-in-interest over Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947; and
The land classification status of Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947.
Thereafter, the Court of Appeals is DIRECTED to RESOLVE the present case in accordance with this Decision with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 229338, April 17, 2024","MANILA PENINSULA HOTEL, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Manila Peninsula, registered with the Large Taxpayers Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), is a duly registered domestic corporation with address at Ayala Avenue corner Makati Avenue, Makati City. It was incorporated on April 4, 1974, with the following primary purpose:
""To lease real estate, and to erect thereon hotels and other buildings and improvements; to own, lease, operate, manage and administer hotels, apartment hotels, and all other facilities, accommodations, adjunct and accessories appurtenant to a general hostelry business; to furnish entertainment and otherwise perform any and all things for the pleasure, comfort and convenience of hotel guests, tenants and other customers; to promote travel and tourism; and otherwise, to handle and engage in other allied businesses; provided that the Corporation will cater only to its hotel customers and their guests.[6] (Citation omitted)
Respondent, on the other hand, is the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), with the authority to act on claims for refund or tax credit of erroneously or excessively paid taxes. It holds office at the BIR National Office Building, BIR Road, Diliman, Quezon City.

During taxable year (TY) 2010, Manila Peninsula provided hotel room accommodations and food and beverage services to Delta Air, a foreign corporation with a License to Transact Business in the Philippines (License) dated December 29, 2009, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under such License, Delta Air is allowed to establish a branch office in the Philippines to engage in international air transport services.[7]

Delta Air provides room accommodations and food and beverage services to its pilots and cabin crew during flight layovers in the Philippines. For this purpose, an agreement was executed between Delta Air and Manila Peninsula wherein the latter would provide room accommodations and food and beverage services to the former's pilots and cabin crew during flight layovers in the Philippines. The cost of hotel services would be directly charged to Delta Air and would not constitute compensable income for its crew but a business expense of the airline.[8]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Manila Peninsula Hotel, Inc. (Manila Peninsula) seeks the reversal and setting aside of the Decision[2] dated July 12, 2016 and Resolution[3] dated January 17, 2017 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA EB) in CTA EB No. 1408. The CTA EB denied Manila Peninsula's petition for review and affirmed the Decision[4] dated August 14, 2015 and Resolution[5] dated December 10, 2015 of the CTA Third Division (CTA Division), which held that Manila Peninsula's sale of services to Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta Air) is not subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT) zero­ rating for failure to satisfy the requisites to be entitled to it.","The Petition is meritorious.
 
Exhaustion of administrative remedies and requirements to assail BIR issuance.
 

Manila Peninsula claims that Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 46-2008 and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 31-2011 are not controlling BIR issuances because they are contrary to Section 108(B)(4) of the NIRC, as amended. The CIR, on the other hand, argues that Manila Peninsula's challenge against the foregoing BIR issuances is a collateral attack on the duly issued administrative issuances which the law frowns upon.[49]

In Banco De Oro, et al. v. Republic of the Phils., et al.,[50] the Court, sitting En Banc, declared that the CTA has undisputed jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation when raised by the taxpayer in disputing or contesting an assessment or claiming a refund. The CTA may likewise take cognizance of cases directly challenging the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation or administrative issuance (revenue orders, revenue memorandum circulars, rulings). The Court En Banc further declared that:
[W]ith respect to administrative issuances (revenue orders, revenue memorandum circulars, or rulings), these are issued by the Commissioner under its power to make rulings or opinions in connection with the implementation of the provisions of internal revenue laws. Tax rulings, on the other hand, are official positions of the Bureau on inquiries of taxpayers who request clarification on certain provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, other tax laws, or their implementing regulations. Hence, the determination of the validity of these issuances clearly falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7(1) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, subject to prior review by the Secretary of Finance, as required under Republic Act No. 8424.[51] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
There is no dispute that what is involved in the present case is the CIR's exercise of the power to interpret tax laws under the first paragraph of Section 4 of the NIRC, as amended, which is subject to review by the Secretary of Finance:[52]
Section 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases. — The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated July 12, 2016 and Resolution dated January 17, 2017 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1408, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
 
Item 11 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 46-2008 and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 31-2011 are DECLARED NULL and VOID insofar as they imposed additional conditions which are not found in Section 108(B)(4) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9337.

"G.R. No. 242362, April 17, 2024","LEONORA O. DELA CRUZ-LANUZA, PETITIONER, VS. ALFREDO M. LANUZA, JR. AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Leonora O. Dela Cruz-Lanuza (Leonora) filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage based on the lack of a valid marriage license and/or psychological incapacity with the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 124.[4]

Leonora was married to Alfredo M. Lanuza, Jr. (Alfredo) in June 1984. They have four children together.[5]

In her petition, Leonora said that although their marriage contract states that a marriage license was secured from the Local Civil Registry of Imus, Cavite, she did not secure any such license, nor did she appear before the same.[6]

She claimed that, although their married life started smoothly, Alfredo later showed signs of psychological incapacity which led to the marriage's breakdown.

During the hearing before the Regional Trial Court, Leonora testified that she and Alfredo met at work. They eventually married on June 9, 1984. However, they did not apply for a marriage license prior to their marriage, nor did they appear before the Local Civil Registry of Imus, Cavite.[7]

Later on, Alfredo's behavior changed. He would come home late or early morning after a night out with friends. He neglected his duty and did not provide food for the family.[8] He treated Leonora as an ordinary occupant of the house; not as his wife.[9] Alfredo also engaged in illicit affair.[10]

In 1994, Alfredo and Leonora separated.[11] It was also in 1994 when Alfredo married a certain Mary Ann Makalintal in Quezon City.[12] Thereafter, Leonora filed a complaint for bigamy against Alfredo. However, the complaint for bigamy was archived because Alfredo could not be found.[13]

Alfredo was a police officer, but was dismissed from service after he went on AWOL because of the bigamy case. The mail sent by Leonora's counsel to Alfredo was returned with a notation ""deceased,"" but there is no record regarding his death.[14]

In 2000, Alfredo married Jane Alejo, as shown by pictures posted on Facebook. He later remarried Jane in a church wedding.[15]

To support her allegation that Alfredo married two other women, Leonora attached a Certification issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority that as per the record of marriages, the name ""Alfredo Jr. Mares Lanuza"" comes out in three records:

Date of marriage: October 16, 2000
Place of marriage: Santo Domingo, Nueva Ecija
Name of Bride/Groom: JAINE P. ALEJO/ALFREDO M. LANUZA
*****
 
Date of marriage: June 09, 1984
Place of marriage: Ermita, Manila
Name of Bride/Groom: LEONORA DELA CRUZ/ALFREDO JR LANUZA
*****
 
Date of marriage: February 22, 1994
Place of marriage: Quezon City, Metro Manila (2nd District)
Name of Bride/Groom: MARY ANN DUNGCA MAKALINTAL/ALFRED JR MARES LANUZA[16]
Leonora further testified that Alfredo abandoned his family and did not provide any financial support. The only instance when Alfredo visited his children was in 1999, during the recognition day in school. However, he only stayed for less than an hour.[17]

Advised by a lawyer, Leonora underwent a psychological evaluation and the psychologist concluded that Alfredo was psychologically incapacitated to comply with his marital obligations.[18]","Unjustified absence from the marital home for decades may be considered as part of the totality of evidence that a person is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage.

On the procedural issue, we rule that the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing the appeal on the ground that it was the wrong remedy.

Considering that the appeal was filed in 2018, or prior to the effectivity of the 2019 Rules of Civil Procedure, we apply the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

The RTC Decision denying the Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage was promulgated in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. Thus, the proper mode of appeal would have been an ordinary appeal under Rule 41(a),[70] or a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 if the matters raised are purely questions of law.[71]

An appeal under Rule 42, availed of by petitioner, would have been appropriate if the questioned RTC Decision was rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.[72]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The May 31, 2018 and October 2, 2018 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155807 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The marriage of petitioner Leonora O.

On August 13, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) directed Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk of Court to submit a verified report on cases pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah, which must provide information on the following: (1) cases where the defense already rested its cases, and cases submitted for decision/resolution; (2) cases with pending motions/incidents; and (3) cases that have not progressed for more than three months. The report was required in lieu of the judicial audit that is usually conducted in preparation for a judge's impending retirement.[4]

On September 7, 2020, Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk submitted a report, but it was rejected by the OCA because it did not comply with the required form. Twice, Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk requested for extensions of time to submit their report, which were both granted by the OCA. Thus, it was only on October 29, 2020 that the OCA received the Verified Report, which was almost a month after Judge Balo's optional retirement took effect on October 3, 2020.[5]

In the meantime, the OCA sent to Judge Balo the OCA Memorandum[6] dated September 30, 2020, directing him to explain, within 10 days from notice, his failure to decide/resolve the cases enumerated in the OCA Memorandum, and/or incidents pending before his official station as Presiding Judge of Branch 44, RTC Surallah. An extension of time to respond to the OCA Memorandum was requested by Judge Balo, which was granted by the OCA.[7]

Judge Balo received the OCA Memorandum on October 2, 2020, a day before his retirement on October 3, 2020. Thus, the deadline for Judge Balo's submission of his reply to the OCA Memorandum was extended from the original date of October 12, 2020, to October 27, 2020.[8]

In his Letter[9] dated October 27, 2020 (Letter), Judge Balo admitted that he incurred delay in the disposition of two criminal cases[10] pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah, particularly by failing to immediately promulgate judgment after the accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. He also admitted that he incurred delay in the resolution of pending incidents in several criminal and civil cases before the same sala. He mainly pointed to heavy workload and the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reasons for the delay.[11]

However, the OCA found no merit in Judge Balo's explanations. It emphasized that Judge Balo should have requested for an extension of time to resolve the cases pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah instead of unilaterally prolonging the disposition of the cases or resolution of the incidents pending therein. It also found that several of the delays were incurred even before the COVID-19 pandemic set in. The OCA further highlighted that Judge Balo acted without authority and with Gross Ignorance of the Law when he continued to issue orders and resolve pending incidents in Branch 44, RTC Surallah even after he was already appointed as full-time Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 19, RTC Isulan.[12]

Thus, on May 25, 2021, the OCA filed with the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) its Memorandum,[13] recommending the conduct of inquiry on Judge Balo and that he be found guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Undue Delay in Rendering Decisions or Orders. It particularly identified 7 criminal cases that were not decided within the reglementary period, 14 criminal cases with pending incidents, and 5 civil cases with pending incidents.[14]
","The Court resolves the administrative disciplinary proceedings against respondent Judge Lorenzo F. Balo (Judge Balo), charging him with Gross Ignorance of the Law and Undue Delay in Rendering Decisions or Orders.","The Court finds Judge Balo guilty of three counts of Gross Neglect of Duty and imposes upon him the penalty of fines, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.

The Court retains administrative jurisdiction over Judge Balo despite his optional retirement on October 3, 2020
 

Preliminarily, the Court finds it proper to clarify when the present administrative disciplinary proceedings were instituted against Judge Balo.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds former Judge Lorenzo F. Balo GUILTY of three counts of Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Functions and imposes upon him the penalty of fines in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 for each count of Gross Neglect of Duty, for a total aggregate of fines in the amount of PHP 600,000.00. Former Judge Lorenzo F. Balo is DIRECTED to PAY the fines imposed within a period not exceeding three months from the time of promulgation of this Decision. If unpaid within the required period, the fines imposed may be deducted from the retirement benefits, including accrued leave credits, due Judge Lorenzo F. Balo."
"G.R. No. 242133, April 16, 2024","ROSELYN AGACID Y DEJANIO* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND MARIA ALEXANDRIA BISQUERRA Y NUEVA,** RESPONDENTS.
","On August 31, 2014, Maria Alexandria Bisquerra (Bisquerra) went to the Cubao Police Station to complain about her ex-partner Agacid. In her Complaint-Affidavit,[4] she narrated that she and Agacid were in a four-year relationship until they broke up in March 2014. They met again on August 31, 2014 in Starbucks, Ali Mall, Cubao, Quezon City at around 4:00 p.m. so Bisquerra could return the items that Agacid gave her during their relationship.[5]

According to Bisquerra, Agacid thought that they would talk and fix their relationship, but Bisquerra insisted on the break-up as she no longer liked Agacid. At that moment, Agacid got angry. She slapped Bisquerra and stabbed her on her right forearm with a sharp object which wounded her.[6]

Bisquerra ran away and asked for help from the guards at Ali Mall, but Agacid had already escaped. Bisquerra went to Quezon Memorial Medical Center to have her wound treated, after which she went to the Cubao Police Station to file her Complaint.[7]

Agacid was eventually charged with violation of Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 9262 before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.[8] The Information reads:

That on or about the 31st day of August 2014, in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously commit physical abuse upon one MARIA ALEXANDRIA BISQUERA y NUEVA, her former lover and live-in partner, by then and there slapping her and stabbing her on the forearm with a cutter causing laceration on the proximal 3rd or the right forearm, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.","Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 also applies even if the perpetrator is a woman, so long as the victim is a woman.
This Court resolves the Petition for Review[1] assailing the Court of Appeals Decision[2] which found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Regional Trial of Court when it issued Orders[3] denying the Motion to Quash with Motion to Defer Arraignment and Pre-trial filed by Roselyn Agacid (Agacid).","While petitioner is correct that Garcia did not involve a lesbian relationship, this pronouncement has nevertheless been reiterated and affirmed in a succeeding case.

Jacinto v. Fouts[44] discussed the application of Garcia in a lesbian relationship. Jacinto involved a woman accused of violating Republic Act No. 9262 against her live-in partner who is also a woman. During trial, she also moved to quash the Information, arguing that the facts charged do not constitute an offense as the law does not apply to lesbian relationships.[45]

When the Regional Trial Court denied her motion, she went to the Supreme Court through a Rule 45 petition for review, raising the same argument.[46] Procedurally, the Court in Jacinto also reiterated the rule that:

""[t]he remedy against the denial of a motion to quash is for the movant accused to enter a plea, go to trial, and should the decision be adverse, reiterate on appeal from the final judgment and assign as error the denial of the motion to quash. The denial, being an interlocutory order, is not appealable, and may not be the subject of a petition for certiorari because of the availability of other remedies in the ordinary course of law.""[47] (Citation omitted)

In denying the petition, this Court squarely ruled that Republic Act No. 9262 applies to lesbian relationships:

Contrary to petitioner's submission that the foregoing disquisition in Garcia was a mere obiter dictum, the Court notes that one of the issues raised in Garcia is the supposed discriminatory and unjust provisions of [Republic Act No.] 9262 which are likewise violative of the equal protection clause. The foregoing discussion of the Court as to the applicability of the law to lesbian relationships is clearly a resolution of the particular issue raised in Garcia and not a mere obiter dictum or an opinion of the Court. The statement of the Court that ""[t]here is likewise no merit to the contention that [Republic Act No.] 9262 singles out the husband or father as the culprit"" further amplifies that the issue of whether [Republic Act No.] 9262 only applies to male perpetrators was indeed raised in the said case.[48] (Citation omitted)","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The August 24, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151014 is AFFIRMED. The Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 229 is ordered to proceed with the trial of Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-10244-CR with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 270564, April 16, 2024","SMARTMATIC TIM CORPORATION AND SMARTMATIC PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS EN BANC, ELISEO MIJARES RIO, JR., AUGUSTO CADELIÑA LAGMAN, FRANKLIN FAYLOGA YSAAC, AND LEONARDO OLIVERA ODOÑO,* RESPONDENTS.","On October 27, 2023, the COMELEC published the Invitation to Bid for the Lease of Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count (FASTrAC) for the 2025 NLE.[8] On October 30, 2023, Smartmatic purchased the bidding documents.[9] On November 13, 2023, SMMT-TIM 2016, Inc. (an entity related to, but separate from, Smartmatic) attended the Pre-Bid Conference.[10]

In the meantime, private respondents Eliseo Mijares Rio, Jr., Augusto Cadelina Lagman, Franklin Fayloga Ysaac, and Leonardo Olivera Odoño (Rio, Jr. et al.) filed a petition,[11] supplemental petition,[12] and second supplemental petition[13] before the COMELEC En Banc. In their petitions, Rio, Jr. et al. alleged that: (a) the transmission of the results of certain precincts preceded the printing of election results; (b) a scheme to clone vote counting machine (VCM) transmissions was shown by the fact that the logs reflect the same internet protocol (IP) address for certain machines instead of separate IP addresses; and (c) Smartmatic's affiliates and/or representatives reportedly met with the representatives of a presidential candidate while Smartmatic's Secure Electronic Transmission Services (SETS) Contract for the 2022 NLE results was still in force, in violation of Clause 5.13 of the SETS Contract.[14] Among other reliefs, Rio, Jr. et al. prayed that ""[t]he qualifications of Smartmatic be reviewed by the [Bids and Awards Committee (BAC)] in view of the serious and material irregularities in the transmission and reception of election results in the system which Smartmatic developed and provided for the [May 9, 2022] Elections,""[15] and that the COMELEC En Banc order the BAC to ""disqualify or declare ineligible Smartmatic from participating in the procurement for the 2025 Automated Election System"" if the ""serious and grave irregularities"" are not satisfactorily explained.[16]

On August 10, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc directed its Law Department to review and submit a recommendation on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[17] On August 31, 2023, the COMELEC Law Department submitted its Compliance, opining that there is no legal basis to prohibit Smartmatic from participating in the bidding process.[18]

On October 5, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc set the case for hearing on October 17, 2023.[19] It also required Smartmatic to comment on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[20]

During the October 17, 2023 hearing, the COMELEC En Banc required the parties to file their respective memoranda and formal offer of evidence within five days, and their respective reply memoranda within three days from receipt of the other party's memorandum.[21]

On November 29, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc ruled in favor of Rio, Jr. et al. The dispositive portion of its Resolution reads:","In exercising its constitutional mandate to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referenda, and recall, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) must comply with existing laws and regulations, including Republic Act No. 9184,[1] or the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA), and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations[2] (2016 Revised IRR).
Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari (With Extremely Urgent Application for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) With Urgent Motion for Special Raffle[3] under Rule 65, Rules of Court filed by petitioners Smartmatic TIM Corporation (Smartmatic TIM) and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. (Smartmatic PH) (collectively referred to as Smartmatic), assailing the November 29, 2023 Resolution[4] of the COMELEC En Banc, which disqualified Smartmatic from participating in any bidding process for elections.","In so ruling, the Court does not weigh the merits of the US DOJ's allegations against Bautista. The Court merely notes that under the GPRA and its 2016 Revised IRR, the COMELEC would not have been compelled to accept the bid of a bidder which it has reasonable grounds to believe committed misrepresentation in its bidding documents and engaged in corrupt activities to secure a previous government contract.

Having declared that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in disqualifying Smartmatic, We now determine the effects of this declaration.

To recall, the SBAC has completed the bidding process for the lease of FASTrAC for the 2025 NLE and the COMELEC has awarded the 2025 FASTrAC Contract to Miru Systems.[162] Thus, an order requiring the COMELEC to instruct the SBAC to accept Smartmatic's bid would be an exercise in futility, as there is no ongoing public bidding for FASTrAC in which Smartmatic may participate.

For reasons of equity, justice, and practicality, neither can the Court nullify the procurement activities carried out by the SBAC and order the COMELEC to conduct public bidding anew. The COMELEC's assailed Resolution has produced consequences that the Court simply cannot ignore, and the prospective application of the Court's Decision is the more prudent recourse under the circumstances.

Relying on the assailed Resolution, the SBAC prevented Smartmatic and its related entities from submitting a bid for the lease of FASTrAC and proceeded with the procurement process, eventually determining that Miru Systems was the bidder with the Single Calculated Responsive Bid and recommending that the COMELEC award Miru Systems the 2025 FASTrAC Contract.[163] As a result, the COMELEC issued the Notice of Award to Miru Systems, and executed the 2025 FASTrAC Contract with Miru Systems.[164]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc dated November 29, 2023 is REVERSED.

This ruling shall be PROSPECTIVE in application from the date of finality of this Decision.

The prayer of petitioners Smartmatic TIM Corporation and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction and status quo ante order is DENIED.

The Manifestation of Profuse Apology and Motion filed by the Commission on Elections is NOTED."
"G.R. No. 228357, April 16, 2024","C.P. REYES HOSPITAL AND ANGELINE M. REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. GERALDINE M. BARBOSA, RESPONDENT.
","On January 22, 2014, Barbosa filed a Complaint[7] for illegal dismissal against C.P. Reyes Hospital et al., praying for reinstatement with full backwages and the award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees.

In her Position Paper,[8] Barbosa alleged that she applied for the position of Training Supervisor with C.P. Reyes Hospital. In September 2013, she was instructed to sign a probationary employment contract[9] for a period of six months, from September 4, 2013 to March 4, 2014. Under the contract, Barbosa would train as a Staff Nurse for the first two months; as Ward Head Nurse and Supervisor for the next two months; and finally, as Training Supervisor for the last two months. The contract required Barbosa to ""get or maintain an average of a passing score equivalent to 80% (Satisfactory).""[10] The contract also provided that ""[f]ailure to meet the reasonable standard set by this Hospital may warrant the penalty of termination of [Barbosa's] employment.""[11]

On October 25, 2013, Barbosa alleged that Human Resource Manager Reyes and Nursing Director Joel M. Lirio (Lirio) told her that she would not be made Training Supervisor because the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Head Nurse had also applied for the position and was supposedly more qualified than her.[12]

On November 27, 2013, Barbosa received a Notice to Explain[13] from Lirio directing her to explain why no disciplinary action should be taken against her for being absent without official leave (AWOL) on November 4, 7, and 8, 2013. On the same day, Reyes told Barbosa that she will not be made a regular employee.[14]

In a Letter[15] dated November 28, 2013, Barbosa explained that she was able to notify the supervisor on duty regarding her November 4 absence, and that for the absences on November 7 and 8, she submitted a medical certificate, as well as the requisite leave forms.[16]

On November 29, 2013, Barbosa received a Letter[17] from Reyes formally terminating her probationary employment. The Letter stated:
MS. GERALDINE M. BARBOSA
Staff Nurse – Probationary

As stated on your Probationary Contract, continuous employment shall ripen only upon showing of satisfactory performance during your training period. Unfortunately, the negative performance feedback received by this office due to attitude including the attendance records reflects [sic] that you have failed to meet the reasonable standards set by the Hospital. In this regard, please be informed that your probationary contract shall end on the stated date, without renewal or regularization.

Contract Period: September 4, 2013 – March 3, 2014[18]

End Contract: December 30, 2013

PAUL ADRIAN M. REYES, MHA
       Hospital Administrator[19]
C.P. Reyes Hospital confirmed that it hired Barbosa on a probationary basis as Training Supervisor. During her employment, Barbosa's evaluators noted that while she gained passing marks,[20] she ""lacked initiative, demonstrated poor time management, needed improvement with documentation[,] and more familiarization with common nursing procedure.""[21] C.P. Reyes Hospital also alleged that Barbosa was very unreceptive of her performance evaluations and that she even accused her evaluators of deliberately giving her low marks, apparently influenced by a certain ""[Ma'am] Flor.""[22] Further, they claim that due process was complied with in Barbosa's termination because her employment was probationary, and that the two-notice rule does not apply to probationary employees.[23] Finally, C.P. Reyes Hospital alleged that Barbosa had 13[24] absences in the course of her employment, some of which were unauthorized. Thus, C.P. Reyes Hospital deemed it proper to terminate the employment of Barbosa.[25]","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioners C.P. Reyes Hospital (C.P. Reyes Hospital) and Angeline M. Reyes[2] (Reyes; collectively, C.P. Reyes Hospital et al.) assailing the Decision[3] dated April 18, 2016 and the Resolution[4] dated November 17, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 139468, which reversed and set aside the Decision[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated September 30, 2014 in NLRC LAC No. 08-002077-14, and accordingly, declared respondent Geraldine M. Barbosa (Barbosa) to have been illegally dismissed by C.P. Reyes Hospital. In turn, the NLRC reversed the Decision[6] of the Labor Arbiter (LA) dated June 24, 2014 in NLRC NCR Case No. RAB IV-01-00097-14-B, which found Barbosa to have been illegally dismissed.","The Petition is denied.

""[T]o justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, petitioners must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon it. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. To be considered 'grave,' discretion must be exercised in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.""[40]

Thus, case law instructs that ""[i]n labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition.""[41]

Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it held that C.P. Reyes Hospital validly terminated Barbosa's employment. Hence, its reversal of the NLRC's ruling is proper.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated April 18, 2016 and the Resolution dated November 17, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 139468 are hereby AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS: (a) the backwages awarded to respondent Geraldine M. Barbosa shall be computed from January 1, 2014, the time her compensation was withheld, up to the finality of this Decision, and (b) legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum is hereby imposed on the monetary awards, computed from the finality of this Decision until fully paid. The rest of the ruling STANDS.

Marital infidelity is one such form of domestic violence that not only transgresses the matrimonial vows of faithfulness and commitment, but also inflicts inconceivable psychological and emotional harm upon the aggrieved spouse and their children. As a form of psychological abuse, marital infidelity destroys the stability and unity of the family at its core, shatters the self-worth and trust of the betrayed spouse, and fosters deep-seated trauma borne of emotional turmoil and related mental health issues. To stem the perpetuation of the cycle of abuse, and to prevent the normalization of extramarital promiscuity in our society, the Court declares marital infidelity to be a form of psychological violence punishable under Republic Act No. 9262, otherwise known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004.

Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] filed by XXX, assailing the Decision[3] and the Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA­-G.R. CR No. 40938. The CA Decision affirmed the Decision[5] rendered by the Branch 144, Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC), in Criminal Case No. R-MKT-17-00580-CR which found XXX guilty of violating Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262.

RA 9262 is a form of social legislation that has the primary objective of protecting women and their children from all forms of domestic violence
 

Before delving into the main issue, the Court finds that a brief discussion on the historical and social contexts that underscore the necessity of Republic Act No. 9262 would be a useful aid in fully elucidating upon the merits of this case.

Violence against women is internationally recognized as a form of discrimination and violation of human rights.[40] Examining violence against women in the human rights framework reveals that the specific causes of such violence are inextricably linked to the broader context of systemic gender-based discrimination and subordination that women are forced to endure.[41] Such violence is a manifestation of the unequal power relationship between men and women, as well as widespread and deeply entrenched gender biases and prejudices against women that have historically placed women beneath men, who are thus in a position to exercise power and control over women.[42]

The discrimination and violence faced by women is an issue of global magnitude with one in three women worldwide having been subjected to either physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.[43] The international community has sought to address violence against women through the following conventions and international agreements.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The November 8, 2019 Decision and the June 22, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40938 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 250763, April 16, 2024","MATTHEW WESTFALL, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA CARMELA D. LOCSIN, AMY LEUNG, NORIKO OGAWA, GIL-HONG KIM, DIWESH SHARAN, RAMESH SUBRAMANIAM, KEN L. CHEE, BIBIANA VICTORIA G. FRANCISCO, TAKEHIKO NAKAO, TOSHIO OYA, MAKOTO KUBOTA, CHRISTOPHER STEPHENS, RAMIT K. NAGPAL, AND DEBORAH STOKES, RESPONDENTS.
","The Petition stemmed from a Complaint[5] for damages filed by Westfall against Locsin et al. for abuse of right and statements allegedly defamatory and damaging to Westfall's professional reputation. Westfall specifically referred to statements in the VP Panel Notes[6] and Interview Report[7] describing his knowledge, experience, and capabilities. These documents were prepared by the Screening Committee (SC) for the position of Technical Advisor (Urban and Water) in the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Respondents Locsin et al. were members of the SC. Westfall, a former staff of the ADB, applied for the position but was not selected.

Aggrieved, Westfall resorted to ADB's internal grievance process on the ground that the selection process violated ADB's administrative procedures. He pointed to two documents from ADB that contained allegedly defamatory statements:
The first document was a redacted copy of the VP Panel Notes[8] dated February 16, 2015 prepared by the SC. The document stated that ""Mr. Westfall has been away from the urban sector work for quite some time and he has not kept his knowledge current.""[9] Westfall considered this as ""highly disparaging, grossly inaccurate and factually incorrect.""[10] According to Westfall, the Notes included ""highly defamatory language that maliciously maligned [Westfall's] reputation, imputed upon him alleged defects in his credentials and discredited his person and professional background.""[11]

The second document was the Interview Report,[12] likewise prepared by the SC, containing notes on Westfall's interview. He claimed that the Interview Report contained unfounded, deeply malicious, and false statements, as the statements failed to accurately reflect his strong performance evaluations and years of professional contributions to ADB.[13]
Petitioner also filed a criminal complaint for libel against the SC.

In their defense, Locsin et al. averred that, as ADB officers and employees, they are immune from all legal processes of any kind with respect to acts performed in their official capacities.[14] They further claimed that the complaint failed to state a cause of action with respect to respondents Takehiko Nakao, Toshio Oya, Makoto Kubota, Christopher Stephens, Ramit K. Nagpal, and Deborah Stokes (Nakao et al.).

Westfall countered that diplomatic immunity does not extend to respondents' allegedly abusive and criminal acts.[15] Also, both the complaint and annexes must be considered in resolving a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a cause of action.[16]

Sustaining Locsin et al.'s defenses of functional immunity and failure to state a cause of action, Branch 138, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City dismissed the complaint.[17] The RTC held that Locsin et al. have immunities with respect to acts performed in their official capacities. It then concluded that they ""acted in the performance of their official duties for the nature of their work necessitated a discussion and recording of the candidate's merits and demerits.""[18] The RTC further ruled that the complaint failed to state a cause of action with respect to respondents Nakao, et al.[19]

Westfall moved for reconsideration, but the RTC denied his motion.[20] On certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), the CA denied the petition for lack of merit.[21] It ruled that whether Locsin et al. acted in their official capacity is a question of fact, and, therefore, outside the purview of a Rule 65 petition.[22] However, even if the CA were to review the question of fact, it is convinced that there is sufficient evidence that Locsin et al., as members of the SC, were acting in their official capacity and within the scope of their authority.[23] The CA also affirmed the RTC's finding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action against Nakao et al.[24]","Functional immunity does not extend to all acts and utterances made by officials and personnel of the Asian Development Bank. The protection is limited, applying only to acts performed in an official capacity. Where the act is ultra vires, such as a crime or an act contrary to law, immunity does not apply. Courts have the power and duty to inquire into the factual basis of the invoked protection.

This resolves the Motion for Partial Reconsideration Ad Cautelam with Motion to Refer the Case to the Court En Banc and Set the Case for Oral Arguments (Motions)[1] filed by respondents Maria Carmela D.

","These consolidated cases draw their collective origin from the anomalies which avowedly attended the utilization and disbursement of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocations of Clarete for the years 2007 to 2009.

In its SAO Report No. 2012-03, the Special Audits Office (SAO) of the Commission on Audit (COA) found that during the Calendar Years 2007 to 2009, the PDAF was not properly released by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and several implementing agencies (IA) did not appropriately, efficiently, and effectively utilize the PDAF. As it happened, the DBM released the funds for projects identified by the legislators notwithstanding that such projects were to be implemented outside the legislative districts of the sponsoring legislators. It further discovered that the funds released to the IAs for the implementation of projects did not pertain to the IAs' mandated functions. Moreso, the IAs failed to comply with existing laws and rules and regulations in the disbursement of funds.[13]

On the strength of the SAO Report No. 2012-03, and upon the independent field validations that the OMB itself conducted, the OMB­ Mindanao Field Investigation Unit filed a Complaint,[14] docketed as OMB-C­ C-14-0248, against Clarete and several other government officials and employees, private individuals, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).[15] The accused were alleged to have acted in conspiracy to misuse Clarete's PDAF allocations covered by the following Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs):

SARO No. ROCS-07-07894 dated October 10, 2007 under NCA No. 349022-2 dated December 20, 2007;
SARO No. ROCS-08-04170 dated May 8, 2008 under NCA No. 363223-0 dated June 12, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-08-00596 dated January 10, 2008 under NCA No. 362406-2 dated March 6, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-09-04240 dated June 25, 2009;
SARO No. ROCS-08-08961 dated November 4, 2008 under NCA No. 377716-3 dated December 9, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-09-03611 dated May 26, 2009 under NCA No. 381431-1 dated July 1, 2009; and
SARO No. D-08-01438 dated February 8, 2008 under NCA No. 252804-6 dated February 15, 2008.[16]
During the subject period, the DBM released Clarete's PDAF totaling to PHP 65 million to the IAs she identified and after the DBM issued the corresponding SAROs and NCAs to the IAs, Clarete endorsed the following NGOs as ""project partners"" for the implementation of the Integrated Livelihood Development Projects in her congressional district:

Kabuhayan at Kalusugang Alay sa Masa Foundation, Inc. (KKAMFI)
Kasangga sa Magandang Bukas Foundation, Inc. (KMBFI)
Aaron Foundation Philippines, Inc. (AFPI)[17]
Thereupon, the funds representing the cost of the projects/activities covered by the PHP 65-million PDAF of Clarete, i.e., livelihood technology kits (LTKs), farm input packages, and livelihood training course packages (LTCPs), were transferred from the IAs to the foregoing NGOs pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) between Clarete, the IAs, as well as the NGOs. Theoretically, after the execution of such MOAs, the projects/activities were ripe for distribution by the NGOs to the identified beneficiaries in the municipalities of the First District of Misamis Oriental. However, no distribution was ever made by the NGOs.[18]","At the pith of the instant controversy are three separate Petitions for Certiorari anchored on a common factual backdrop and hinged upon interrelated issues involving the same parties.
A diegeses of the Petitions follow.

1.
The Petition for Certiorari[1] in G.R. No. 232968 was filed by petitioner Marina P. Clarete (Clarete), former Representative of the First District of Misamis Occidental, 14th Congress. It seeks to nullify and set aside the Resolution[2] and the Order[3] of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-C-C-14-0248. In the challenged Resolution, the OMB found probable cause to charge Clarete and her co-accused with 18 counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019,[4] seven counts of malversation of public funds, and 11 counts of malversation of public funds through falsification. On the other hand, the Order of the OMB denied Clarete's Motion for Reconsideration;[5]
 	 
2.
In his Petition for Certiorari[6] in G.R. No. 232974, petitioner Arthur Cua Yap (Yap), former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), inveighs against the same OMB issuances[7] assailed in G.R. No. 232968; and
 	 
3.
Finally, via another Petition for Certiorari[8] docketed as G.R. Nos. 238584–87, Yap impugns the two Resolutions issued by the Sandiganbayan (SBN) in SB-17-CRM-1510-1545, where he stood accused of two counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, one count of malversation of public funds, and one count of malversation through falsification. The first SBN Resolution[9] struck down Yap's Motion for Partial Reconsideration with Motion to Quash Informations,[10] while the subsequent Resolution[11] denied his Motion for Reconsideration thereof.[12]","The Petitions for Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 232968 and G.R. No. 232974 ought to be dismissed on the ground of mootness.

In Relampagos v. Sandiganbayan,[44] citing People v. Castillo,[45] this Court distinguished the two kinds of determination of probable cause and shed light on the corresponding effect of an ensuing judicial determination of probable cause, viz.:

The executive determination of probable cause is one made during preliminary investigation. It is a function that properly pertains to the public prosecutor who is given a broad discretion to determine whether probable cause exists and to charge those whom he believes to have committed the crime as defined by law and thus should be held for trial. Otherwise stated, such official has the quasi-judicial authority to determine whether or not a criminal case must be filed in court. Whether or not that function has been correctly discharged by the public prosecutor, i.e., whether or not he has made a correct ascertainment of the existence of probable cause in a case, is a matter that the trial court itself does not and may not be compelled to pass upon.

The judicial determination of probable cause, on the other hand, is one made by the judge to ascertain whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused. The judge must satisfy himself that based on the evidence submitted, there is necessity for placing the accused under custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. If the judge finds no probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue the arrest warrant.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions for Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 232968 and G.R. No. 232974, are DISMISSED on the ground of mootness.

On the other hand, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Arthur Cua Yap in G.R. Nos. 238584-87 is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Resolutions dated November 28, 2017 and March 1, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan (SBN) in SB-17-CRM-1510-1545 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Yap's Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Resolution dated 15 August 2017) with Motion to Quash Informations is GRANTED and the cases against him before the Sandiganbayan, docketed as SB-17-CRM-1526, SB-17-CRM-1527, SB-17-CRM-1531, and SB-17-CRM-1544, are hereby DISMISSED."
" G.R. No. 257871, April 15, 2024 ","HJA FERWINA JIKIRI AMILHAMJA, ANANG AGANG HAWANG, NENITA PINO AGUIL, AUDIE SINCO JANEA, AND ABDURASA SARIOL ARASID,* PETITIONERS, VS. OMBUDSMAN-MINDANAO, FIELD INVESTIGATION UNIT, REPRESENTED BY: LIWAYWAY SUMAGAYSAY-RONDINA, RESPONDENT.","Arasid, in his capacity as President of Sulu State College (SSC), issued a Memorandum[6] dated May 10, 2011, requesting the SSC Board of Trustees (SSC-BOT) to formulate a resolution to purchase physics, computer engineering, and agricultural equipment (subject items) with funds sourced from SSC's local income. Pursuant to his request, the SSC­-BOT issued Resolution No. 19[7] on May 12, 2011, setting aside the amount of PHP 20,000,000.00 to be paid in quarterly installments for two years. The following day, SSC's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), composed of Amilhamja, as Chairperson, and Hawang, Aguil, Janea, and Joseph Pescadera (Pescadera), as members, issued Resolution No. 3, Series of 2011,[8] approving the publication of the Invitation to Bid for the subject items.[9]

The BAC caused the publication of an Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB) in the Zamboanga Star.[10] On May 25, 2011, the BAC issued Resolution No. 4, Series of 2011,[11] stating that only one prospective bidder, State Alliance Enterprises, Inc.[12] (SAEI), applied for eligibility check; and that it is the exclusive distributor of the subject items willing to deliver them and to be paid on installment basis. The BAC recommended that SSC should negotiate with SAEI as the lone bidder, after finding the latter's bid to be advantageous to SSC.[13]
 
On May 30, 2011, SSC and SAEI entered into a Contract of Agreement for the purchase of tractor, shovel, water hose, grass cutter, knapsack sprayer, wheelbarrow, bolos, magnetism, and electrostatics EST. The total purchase price was PHP 22,000,000.00, to be paid in installments from 2011 to 2014.[14]

On November 28, 2011, some parents and students of SSC wrote the Regional Director of the Commission on Audit (COA) requesting an investigation on the alleged illegal procurement of school computers and agricultural equipment for PHP 22,000,000.00.[15]

On December 13, 2011, the SSC-BOT issued Resolution No. 56, Series of 2011,[16] confirming the authority of Arasid, as President of SSC, to enter into a contract with SAEI through a loan extended by the latter for the purchase of the subject items.[17]

Meanwhile, the COA made the following findings after investigating the purchase made by SSC: first, the public bidding was insufficient and did not comply with Republic Act No. (RA) 9184, or the ""Government Procurement Reform Act"";[18] second, the Zamboanga Star was not a publication of national circulation; and third, the BAC should have declared a failure of the bidding process as there was only one bidder. Instead, the contract was immediately awarded to the lone bidder.[19]

On June 15, 2015, the COA issued a Notice of Disallowance[20] of the transaction due to the following violations: first, only PHP 3,950,000.00 was appropriated for equipment outlay under SSC's corporate operating budget (COB) for calendar year 2011; second, no appropriation was made for capital outlay in the ""General Appropriations Act for 2011;"" third, there was no certification of availability of funds, as required under Sections 46 and 47 of Executive Order No. (EO) 292,[21] or the ""Administrative Code of 1987;"" fourth, Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1445,[22] or the ""Government Auditing Code of the Philippines,"" sanctions officials who enter into a void contract; and finally, the change of the installment term from two years to three years and the increase of the amount to PHP 22,000,000.00 required a BOT resolution.[23]

Subsequently, the Field Investigation Unit of the OMB-Mindanao, respondent herein, filed administrative charges of Grave Misconduct against petitioners and Pescadera.[24]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Hja[2] Ferwina Jikiri Amilhamja (Amilhamja), Anang Agang Hawang (Hawang), Nenita Pino Aguil (Aguil), Audie Sinco Janea (Janea), and Abdurasa Sariol Arasid (Arasid) (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 157038. The CA affirmed with modification the Decision[5] of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-M-A-17-0268.","The Court modifies the ruling of the CA.

Misconduct is the ""transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross neglect of duty by a public officer.""[43] It is grave if the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules are present.[44] Corruption consists in the act of an official who unlawfully or wrongfully uses his or her station or character to procure some benefit for himself or herself, contrary to the rights of others.[45] Flagrant disregard of established rules, as analogous to willful intent to violate the law, is when the public official or employee concerned, through culpable acts or omission, clearly manifests a pernicious tendency to ignore the law or rules.[46] Flagrant disregard of established rules may also be characterized by the employees' propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by their actions.[47]

The Court agrees with the CA that Amilhamja, Hawang, Aguil, and Janea did not comply with several requirements under RA 9184. First, they neither mentioned nor submitted evidence that they prepared the bidding documents required under Article VI, Section 17[48] of RA 9184. Second, they similarly failed to state or prove that they conducted a pre­-procurement conference required under Article VII, Section 20[49] of RA 9184. Third, they also did not prove that there was a representative from the COA and two observers during all stages of the procurement process, as mandated by Article V, Section 13[50] of RA 9184. Fourth, the IAEB was published in the Zamboanga Star, which is not a newspaper of general nationwide circulation.[50] Finally, petitioners recommended that SSC should negotiate with SAEI even though the purchase of the subject items does not qualify for negotiated procurement under Article XVI, Section 53[51] of RA 9184. Notably, Article X, Section 36 of RA 9184 allows a single calculated/rated and responsive bid submission ""[i]f after advertisement, only one prospective bidder submits a Letter of Intent and/or applies for eligibility check, and meets the eligibility requirements or criteria, after which it submits a bid, which is found to be responsive to the bidding requirements."" As such, petitioners need not have recommended negotiation with SAEI if it complied with the eligibility requirements and submitted a responsive bid.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated September 2, 2020 and Resolution dated October 26, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157038 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

Petitioners Hja Ferwina Jikiri Amilhamja, Anang Agang Hawang, Nenita Pino Aguil, and Audie Sinco Janea are found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and are SUSPENDED from service for a period of six (6) months; and

"G.R. No. 267795, April 15, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOSE P. RAGUDO, JR., ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Nancy A. Cacayorin (Cacayorin) was an employee at the Go Group of Companies, while Ragudo was a gate keeper in the compound where the company office is located.[4]

Ragudo was charged with murder, qualified theft, and alarms and scandals in the respective Informations for Criminal Case Nos. 5036-18, 5037-18, and 5038-18, thus:","This Court resolves an appeal[1] filed by Jose P. Ragudo, Jr. (Ragudo), assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that found him guilty of murder and theft.","We modify the conviction in Criminal Case No. 5036-18 from murder to homicide and modify the penalty for the conviction in Criminal Case No. 5037-18 for theft.

To begin, this Court finds that Ragudo's defense of insanity must fail.

Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code provides that one of the circumstances that is exempt from criminal liability is when a person is insane, unless they have acted during a lucid interval.

Insanity in the context of this exempting circumstance is defined in People v. Formigones[117] as being ""deprived completely of reason or discernment and freedom of the will at the time of committing the crime.""[118]

In determining whether a defense of insanity may prosper, this Court laid down the following three-way test in People v. Paña,[119] thus, clarifying the guidelines in Formigones:

Considering the foregoing, we clarify the guidelines laid down in Formigones. Under this test, the insanity defense may prosper if: (1) the accused was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her acts; (2) the inability occurred at the time of the commission of the crime; and (3) it must be as a result of a mental illness or disorder.

We now use a three-way test: first, insanity must be present at the time of the commission of the crime; second, insanity, which is the primary cause of the criminal act, must be medically proven; and third, the effect of the insanity is the inability to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of the act.[120] (Emphasis supplied)

As to the kind of evidence to prove insanity, both ordinary and expert witnesses may testify, although the nature of the mental illness of a person may be best identified by experts with specialized knowledge, thus:

Insanity, as an exempting circumstance, must be shown medically, unless there are extraordinary circumstances and there is no other evidence available. Our procedural rules allow ordinary witnesses to testify on the ""mental sanity of a person with whom [they are] sufficiently acquainted,"" but reports and evaluation from medical experts have greater evidentiary value in determining an accused's mental state. The nature and degree of an accused's mental illness can be best identified by medical experts equipped with specialized knowledge to diagnose a person's mental health.[121] (Citations omitted)","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The September 29, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13991 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Criminal Case No. 158546-TG

That on or about the 2nd day of December 2015, in the City of Taguig, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a gun, with intent to kill and with the qualifying circumstance of treachery, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shot (sic) one JEROME SUMULONG y GAPASIN, hitting him on his left forearm, thereby commencing the commission of the crime of Murder directly by overt acts but failed to perform all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of murder by reason of cause/s other than his own spontaneous desistance, that is, the injuries suffered by the victim was not fatal.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellant, who was assisted by counsel, entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to both charges.[9]

Trial followed.[10]","This resolves the appeal[1] under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court of accused-appellant Nelson Sia, Jr. y Aculña (accused-appellant) seeking a reversal of the Decision[2] dated March 10, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The CA affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] dated May 8, 2019, of Branch 153, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Taguig City in Criminal Case Nos. 158545-TG and 158546-TG that convicted accused-appellant of the crime of Murder, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code;[4] and Attempted Murder, as defined and penalized under the Revised Penal Code, Article 248 in relation to Article 51.[5]","The appeal is denied for lack of merit. However, the award of damages by the CA in Criminal Case No. 158546-TG must be modified to make it conform to law and jurisprudence.

I.
The courts a quo correctly relied upon the testimony of the prosecution witnesses in finding that accused-appellant is the perpetrator of the crimes.
There is no merit to accused-appellant's allegation that the prosecution witnesses could not have identified him as the assailant because it was dark when the incident occurred early morning of December 2, 2015. To the contrary, the prosecution witnesses were able to positively identify accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged because the scene of the crime was fairly lit by a street light, as pointed out by the courts a quo.

The Court agrees with the RTC and the CA that the street light was sufficient to produce favorable conditions for visibility and the identification of accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes. Indeed, illumination from a street light, lamp post, kerosene or wick lamp, moonlight, starlight, flashlight, torch, and lighting from a nearby establishment, have all been deemed sufficient for visibility and identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime charged against him or her.[76]

Pertinently, the Court has held that when the conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness does not appear to foster any ill motive against the accused, his or her testimony as to the manner of the commission of the crime and the identity of the perpetrator must be accepted.[77]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated March 10, 2021, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12982 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that:

","On March 2, 2017, police officers conducted a search and seizure operation at the house of Manalo inside the compound of Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) in Tandang Sora Avenue, Quezon City under Search Warrant No. 5326(7).[4] During the search, several unlicensed firearms and ammunition were allegedly discovered and confiscated. Subsequently, Manalo, Victor Eraño Manalo Hemedez (Hemedez), Jonathan S. Ledesma (Ledesma), and several other individuals were placed in detention. Several Informations were then filed at the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City (OCP-QC), including a charge for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under Section 28(b) of Republic Act No. 10591 docketed as Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03231-CR.[5] The accusatory portion of the Information[6] against Manalo states:
That on or about the 2nd day of March 2017, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, without any authority of law, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control the following small arms or Class A light weapons, to wit:

a) one (1) M-16 Colt Ar 15 rifle with serial number 4952780
b) one (1) M1 carbine with serial number 4161809
c) one (1) 12 gauge Action shotgun with serial number 116534

without first, having secured the necessary license/permit issued by the proper authorities.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]
Manalo filed a Motion for Reinvestigation,[8] which was granted by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 84 of Quezon City (RTC Branch 84). Thus, the RTC directed the OCP-QC to conduct a preliminary investigation.[9]

The city prosecutor issued a Resolution[10] affirming the finding of probable cause against Manalo, Hemedez, and Ledesma.[11] During the interim, Manalo filed his Motion to Fix Bail.[12]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the denial of the Motion to Quash filed by Felix Nathaniel ""Angel"" Villanueva Manalo II (Manalo).","The Petition must be denied.

To recall, petitioner's Motion to Quash Amended Information was anchored on the ground of double jeopardy that is found in Rule 117, Section 3(i) of the Rules of Court.[55] The requisites of double jeopardy are enumerated in Rule 117, Section 7 of the Rules of Court, which states:
SECTION 7. Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy. — When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense[,] which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information. (Emphasis in the original)
Based on the foregoing, double jeopardy exists when the following requisites concur: (1) a first jeopardy attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy has been validly terminated; and (3) a second jeopardy is for the same offense as in the first.[56]

The first jeopardy attaches: (1) after a valid indictment; (2) before a competent court; (3) after arraignment; (4) when a valid plea has been entered; and (5) when the accused was acquitted or convicted, or the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without their express consent.[57]

In the present case, the insistence of petitioner that double jeopardy exists is misplaced. As correctly determined by the CA, the elements for the first jeopardy to attach were not established. The fourth and fifth elements are not present as it was not shown that petitioner had entered a valid plea on the prior charge and that he had been either convicted or acquitted, or that the case against him was dismissed or terminated without his express consent.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed July 13, 2022 Decision and December 19, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 166960 are AFFIRMED..

The Amended Information in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03231-CR is ADMITTED. The Regional Trial Court, Branch 216, Quezon City is ORDERED to proceed with the arraignment and pre-trial of Felix Nathaniel ""Angel"" Villanueva Manalo II with dispatch."
"G.R. No. 258269, April 15, 2024","JOSE ANTONIO PAULO I. REYES, PETITIONER, VS. SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC PHILS. CORP., KEVIN LEE, MINSU CHU, AND SILVER FUNGO, RESPONDENTS.","Reyes was the country manager of Ruckus Wireless, a company specializing in wireless networking solutions. On December 29, 2016, Reyes was asked by Samsung Electronic Philippines Corporation (Samsung) to consider joining its Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Division. He was personally invited by Samsung President and/or Managing Director Kevin Lee (Lee).[7] Through a letter,[8] Samsung formally offered Reyes the position of WLAN Head/National Sales Manager albeit subject to a probationary period.

Reyes eventually decided to join Samsung and was to receive a monthly compensation that matched his previous salary at Ruckus Wireless, amounting to PHP 470,000.00.[9] Reyes then signed the Probationary Contract of Employment[10] and Contract of Employment: Side Agreement Benefits.[11]

After a few months, Samsung informed Reyes in a letter[12] through its IT and Mobile Team (IMT) Acting Head, Rhinn Piczon (Piczon), that he failed to meet the standards for regularization and that his probationary employment would be terminated effective September 27, 2017. Attached to the letter was Reyes' Performance Evaluation Form,[13] which revealed that his overall assessment yielded a score of 4.08—with 5 being the lowest—or a ""needs improvement"" rating.[14]

Reyes subsequently filed a Complaint before the LA against Samsung for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of 13th month pay, regularization, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. He also impleaded Lee, Senior Business Director Minsu Chu (Chu), and Director for Human Relations Silver Fungo (Fungo), as officers of Samsung (Samsung et al.).[15]

Reyes mainly asserted that he was not informed of the performance standards to qualify as a regular employee at the time of his engagement. After signing the employment contract, he allegedly sought clarification from Chu regarding the employment standards, but the latter purportedly gave him vague responses such as ""do what you think is right"" and that Reyes must perform the job based on his own assessment. He was also supposedly assured by Fungo that the probationary period was just a formality.[16]

On the other hand, Samsung et al. asserted that Reyes was apprised of the standards and qualifications at the time of his employment. They also claimed to have regularly reinforced these standards in their weekly leadership team, supply chain management, and consensus meetings.[17]

Samsung et al. further contended that since Reyes held the position of National Sales Manager, it was implied that he should adhere to certain expectations for someone in that role. Stated differently, Reyes had certain responsibilities and expectations that were implied and should have been understood by someone in that role. These expectations included avoiding conflicts with team members, familiarizing oneself with the company's internal procedures and work to be done, and maintaining a professional demeanor in the workplace. Reyes failed to observe all of these.[18]

Samsung et al. claimed that they expected Reyes, as National Sales Manager, to be more aware of his role as a leader among the sales personnel and to act accordingly, but Reyes did not meet these expectations. Consequently, Samsung et al. held performance feedback discussions with Reyes on June 26 and 27, 2017 to give him the opportunity to address his deficiencies, but these attempts were also unsuccessful.[19]

Essentially, Samsung et al. argued that Reyes failed to meet the reasonable standards set for him to qualify as a regular employee, and that even if he became one, he was still validly dismissed due to Samsung's loss of trust and confidence in him.[20]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Jose Antonio Paolo I. Reyes (Reyes) assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). These dispositions upheld the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which affirmed the Labor Arbiter (LA)'s Decision[6] declaring Reyes to have been validly dismissed from his probationary employment.","The Petition is bereft of merit.

Prefatorily, in labor cases, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion as well as other jurisdictional errors committed by the NLRC.[43] ""As such, when a decision of the CA under a Rule 65 petition is brought to this Court by way of a petition for review under Rule 45, only questions of law may be entertained. [After all,] [t]his Court is not a trier of facts.""[44] Our ruling in Montoya v. Transmed[45] is instructive in explaining this limitation, thus:
In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?[46] (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)
While there exist exceptions to this rule,[47] none of these are applicable to the case at hand.

Here, the crux of the controversy lies in the question of whether petitioner was made aware of the reasonable standards for regularization at the time of his engagement—which is clearly a question of fact.

This Court notes that the findings of the LA, the NLRC, and the CA are one in that petitioner was adequately informed of the regularization standards. Settled is the principle that ""findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but finality when affirmed by the CA.""[48] These findings merit full respect and should not be altered, modified, or reversed without justifiable grounds.[49] Here, We find no cogent reason to depart from the court a quo's findings.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The August 26, 2020 Decision and the July 28, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 159808 are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. The Complaint for Illegal Dismissal against respondents Samsung Electronic Phils., Corp., Kevin Lee, Minsu Chu, and Silver Fungo is DISMISSED. Nonetheless, respondent Samsung Electronic Phils., Corp., is ORDERED TO PAY petitioner Jose Antonio Paulo Ignacio Reyes his proportionate 13th month pay of PHP 235,000.00, plus legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be computed from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

A.M. No. MTJ-23-014 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-024-MTJ]
Hon. Sharon M. Alamada[1] (Judge Alamada), Vice-Executive Judge and Presiding Judge of Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Calamba City, Laguna, filed the Complaint,[2] dated June 1, 2021, against Hon. Leah Angeli B. Vasquez-Abad (Judge Abad), Executive Judge and Presiding Judge of Branch 1, MTCC, Calamba City, Laguna, charging the latter of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Rules of Procedure.

Judge Alamada alleged that on April 20, 2021, the Office of the City Prosecutor filed four Informations, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 65207-21 to 65210-21, all against Jeffrey Ostil Tamayo (Tamayo). On April 22, 2021, Tamayo applied for bail by posting a bond. Thereafter, Judge Abad made an assessment of probable cause and issued an Order, dismissing motu proprio three out of the four cases prior to their raffle, as follows: Criminal Case No. 65207-21—Resistance and Disobedience; Criminal Case No. 65209-21—Violation of Section 56(e) of Republic Act No. 4136;[3] and Criminal Case No. 65210-21—Simple Disobedience, which are all governed by the Rule on Summary Procedure.[4]

On April 26, 2021, Criminal Case No. 65208-21, which was for violation of a city ordinance, was subsequently raffled to Judge Alamada. Tamayo pleaded guilty during the hearing on the following day.[5]

According to Judge Alamada, Judge Abad's action in determining probable cause when Tamayo applied for bail is an exercise of adjudicatory power which cannot be exercised by an Executive Judge, pursuant to the Rules. It is also contrary to the following: (1) Administrative Matter No. 05-08-26-SC, where the power to conduct preliminary investigation from judges of First Level Courts was removed; (2) A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC, particularly the definition of the prerogatives and duties of Executive Judges; (3) Section 12 paragraph (b) of the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure; and (4) the Court's ruling in the case of Crespo v. Mogul,[6] where it was held that once a complaint or Information is filed in court, any disposition of the case as to its dismissal or conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the court.[7]

During the raffle on April 26, 2021, Judge Abad did not initially join the raffle through video conferencing, and Judge Alamada presided. However, as there was an issue with regard to the raffle, Judge Abad eventually joined. During the raffle, it was mentioned that the issue involving the Executive Judge's power will be elevated to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for guidance over the matter.[8]

In the afternoon of the same day, Judge Alamada sent an e-mail to then Deputy Court Administrator, now Court Administrator, Raul B. Villanueva (Court Administrator Villanueva), requesting for clarification on the matter. In his response, Court Administrator Villanueva stated that:

To be clear, the role of [Judge Abad] regarding newly-filed cases are to have them raffled. If bail is being applied before raffle, the Guidelines on the Decongestion of Holding Jails require her to raffle the case immediately and she cannot act thereon if the case was not raffled to her, much less determine the existence or absence of probable cause. The [Executive Judge] only acts on applications for bail for raffled cases to courts where all the Judges are not around or when the [Executive Judge] is the pairing court wherein the Judge is absent.[9]

Judge Alamada alleged that this is not the first time that Judge Abad was grossly ignorant of the rules and the law. On January 19, 2018, when an accused who was caught in flagrante was applying for bail, Judge Abad made a determination of probable cause. She did not require the accused to post bail and immediately ordered his release without bail. Since the said case was raffled to Judge Alamada, she was able to rectify it. However, as claimed by Judge Alamada, the three cases which were motu proprio dismissed were not initially included in the raffle; thus, there will be no opportunity for her to rectify the mistake.[10]

Lastly, Judge Alamada argued that the imposition of preventive suspension against Judge Abad is imperative as there is a strong likelihood of the latter's guilt of the serious charge of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Rules of Procedure.[11]

In her Comment,[12] dated September 10, 2021, Judge Abad asserted that she exercised good faith in dismissing Criminal Case Nos. 65207-21, 65209-21, and 65210-21. According to Judge Abad, Criminal Case No. 65207-21, for Resistance and Disobedience to Authority, was dismissed as the second element of the crime—that the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person in authority or his agent—was not present in this case, and that there is no allegation in the Information that the Barangay Police Security Officers gave any direct order to Tamayo which the latter seriously disobeyed.[13]

Criminal Case No. 65209-21, for Violation of Section 56(a) of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, was dismissed for being premature as the case should have been initially reported to the Traffic Adjudication Service of the Land Transportation Office (LTO).[14] Judge Abad also found that the apprehending officer failed to show that he had the express authority from the Commissioner of the LTO or his Deputies to file the case in court.

Criminal Case No. 65210-21, for Simple Disobedience, was dismissed as the second element of the crime—that the offender disobeys such agent of a person in authority, was not present in this case as there is no allegation in the Information that the police officers gave a direct order to Tamayo which the latter disobeyed.[15]

Judge Abad claimed that her action in issuing the Orders, dated April 22, 2021, was borne out of ""ingrained practice of studying immediately the records of the cases whenever an Information is filed."" More so, this practice of studying and evaluating the records is further observed when an application for bail is filed, even before the Branches 2 and 3 [of the MTCC] were organized.""[16]

Judge Abad maintained that her Orders dismissing the three criminal cases were issued in good faith and with due regard to Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 33-2020,[17] dated March 31, 2020. She also cited OCA Circular No. 89-2020, dated April 3, 2020, which suspended the raffle of newly-filed cases and required the Judge-on-Duty to resolve all urgent matters brought before him or her, in accordance with A.C. No. 33-2020, which included the determination of probable cause.[18]",Before the Court are four consolidated administrative cases involving closely-related sets of facts and identical parties.,"In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[124]

In A.M. No. MTJ-23-014 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-024-MTJ], the Court resolves to modify the findings and recommendation of the JIB. As the JIB correctly held, Judge Abad's acts were a result of an error in the interpretation of Supreme Court directives and circulars in relation to her power as an Executive Judge, which she remedied by recalling her issued dismissal orders. Also, taking into consideration that this is the first administrative case against Judge Abad, and in the exercise of its sound discretion based on the facts of the case, the Court deems it proper to merely admonish Judge Abad.

In JIB FPI No. 21-033-MTJ, the Court agrees with the JIB's finding and recommendation to dismiss the administrative complaint. As correctly observed by the JIB, Judge Abad and Judge Sakkam failed to substantiate their allegations of improper conduct against Judge Alamada. Notably, they had no personal knowledge of the only specific instance of improper conduct imputed to Judge Alamada—her phone call with the Clerk of Court during which she allegedly insulted and berated the latter.

In JIB FPI No. 21-042-MTJ, the Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the JIB. Circular No. 1-90[125] grants the MTC and MCTC judges the authority to act as notaries public ex officio in notarizing documents connected with the performance of their official functions and duties. Concomitantly, Canon 2, Section 3 of the NCJC provides that ""[j]udges should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against lawyers or court personnel for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may have become aware."" Thus, when Judge Sakkam notarized the Letter-Complaint of Judge Abad and the Sinumpaang Salaysay of Eraga, he was acting well within his authority as a judge.

Meanwhile, as an Executive Judge, Judge Abad has the power and duty to exercise supervision over the judges and personnel within his or her administrative area.[126] She also has the power and duty to investigate administrative complaints against Municipal and City Judges, and other court personnel within his or her administrative area, and to submit his or her findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court.[127]

Thus, the administrative complaints against Judge Sakkam and Judge Abad are dismissed for lack of merit.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court RESOLVES:

"A.M. No. P-17-3768 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 17-4734-P], April 11, 2024","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. RUEL V. DELICANA, RESPONDENT.","On March 8, 2017, Hon. Marie Ellengrid S.L. Baliguat, (Judge Baliguat) then Executive Judge of Branch 3, MTCC, General Santos City, South Cotabato, wrote to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) informing the latter that Delicana had been charged with two counts of rape before the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP); thus, she is recommending for his suspension from office pending the filing of the cases in court.[1]

In another Letter[2] dated April 25, 2017, Judge Baliguat informed the OCA that two criminal Informations[3] for rape docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17-28750 and 17-28751 were eventually filed against Delicana and were raffled to the Branch 22, Regional Trial Court (RTC), General Santos City; Delicana was able to post a surety bond in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 in each case on March 27, 2017, and that he was already scheduled for arraignment.[4]

In the Resolution[5] dated February 17, 2017 issued by the OCP, the facts leading to the filing of the two Informations[6] are summarized as follows:
Complainant works for [Delicana)'s family as their ""stay-in working student[.""] [Delicana], on the other hand, is a court employee. On January 28, 2017 at around 11:00 [A.M.], while complainant was doing her laundry at the backyard of [Delicana]'s house, the latter suddenly called her. As she went inside the kitchen, [Delicana] suddenly closed the door, grabbed her hand; embraced her, and then pushed her against the concrete wall. Complainant tried to stop [Delicana] from what he was doing but he was too strong for her. [Delicana] thereafter pulled down his short pants and her pajamas and inserted his finger into her sex organ. Complainant cried out of pain but she could not do anything. [Delicana] only stopped when a visitor came looking for him. Complainant immediately went to her room and texted her father to fetch her. After a few minutes, she went out of her room to finish her laundry but [Delicana] was outside her room waiting for her. Again, [Delicana] grabbed her, brought her to the kitchen, pushed her towards the concrete wall, pulled down her pajamas, and inserted his finger into her sex organ. As she felt helpless, she just cried until [Delicana] was able to satisfy his lust. Right after the said incident, she called up her father and insisted that he bring her home.[7]

[Complainant's grandparent] narrated that complainant was still crying when they arrived at [Delicana]'s house. She tried to ask complainant why she was crying, but [Delicana] interrupted and offered her and complainant's father some snacks. Complainant was able to confess to them the incident only after they followed her to her room. Allegedly, complainant was still trembling as she recounted to them the incident. [Complainant's grandparent] then confronted [Delicana] but the latter only answered her with, and to quote: ""Pasensyahan niyo nalang ako nay. (Please just bear with me)."" [Delicana] also told complainant to tell him should she need anything in her school.[8]
According to the OCP, Delicana denied the allegations and claimed that the complaint was private complainant's retaliatory act to his wife who reprimanded her in the morning of the alleged date of the incident.[9] According to him, and as supported by the affidavit of his wife, the latter scolded private complainant for coming home late in the evening despite still being a minor.[10]

Delicana also added that it was impossible for him to commit the alleged acts since he was suffering from ""muscle pain, body fatigue, and physical exhaustion on the alleged date brought about by his long travel from Tagum City back to his home.""[11] His visitor did not observe anything peculiar except for the fact that he looked exhausted.[12] Thus, he was surprised with the arrival of private complainant's sister, parent, and grandparent at his house and when they informed him that they are bringing private complainant back home.[13]

While Delicana admitted to have told private complainant's grandparent to just bear with him, he clarified that he was referring to the castigation made by his wife against private complainant.[14] He, in fact, gave private complainant's grandparent PHP 150.00 for their fare.[15] He maintained that private complainant's grandparent and parent never got the chance to enter his house as they were just talking in the terrace of his house.[16]

To bolster his defense, Delicana attached the affidavits of Sally Obida Baliguat and Radjena A. Koh to his counter-affidavit before the OCP. In gist, the former attested that private complainant frequently arrives at Delicana's house late at night, while the latter affirmed that she indeed went to Delicana's house and had a chat with him on the date of the alleged incident and yet she did not notice anything unusual at that time.[17]

Delicana also argued before the OCP that private complainant and her family are no longer interested in pursuing the complaint against him as they have already submitted a Motion to Withdraw Complaint,[18] Affidavit of Recantation,[19] Affidavit of Desistance & Quitclaim,[20] and Affidavit of Retraction.[21]","This resolves the administrative case against Ruel V. Delicana (Delicana), Legal Researcher, Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), General Santos City, South Cotabato, for Gross Misconduct and Prejudicial Conduct that Gravely Besmirches or Taints the Reputation of the Service.","The Court agrees with the findings of the JIB; verily, We adopt their recommendation.

It cannot be denied that based on the facts, the acts of Delicana fell short of the standards of high moral conduct which court employees are bound to maintain. While indeed, the criminal cases against him were dismissed and his guilt was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, his administrative liability was proven by substantial evidence.

As correctly pointed out by the JIB, to sustain a finding of administrative culpability, only substantial evidence is required; the present case is an administrative case, not a criminal case, against Delicana. Therefore, the quantum of proof required is only substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[83]

Evidence to support a conviction in a criminal case is not necessary, and the dismissal of the criminal case against the Delicana in an administrative case is not a ground for the dismissal of the administrative case.[84] We emphasize the well-settled rule that a criminal case is different from an administrative case and each must be disposed of according to the facts and the law applicable to each case.[85]

Here, there is substantial evidence to show that Delicana violated private complainant; this was supported by the latter's Sinumpaang Salaysay[86] with attached Medico-Legal Certificate.[87] The submission later on by private complainant of affidavits purportedly showing her recantation, desistance, and quitclaim is of no moment.","ACCORDINGLY, We ADOPT the findings of the Judicial Integrity Board. Considering, however, that Ruel V. Delicana had already been previously imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service, with prejudice to re-employment or appointment in any government agency, including government-owned or -controlled corporations, and with forfeiture of benefits, including allowances, bonuses, and retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office and reemployment in the government service, including government-owned and controlled corporations, We deem it proper to impose upon Ruel V. Delicana a FINE in the amount of PHP 400,000.00, the same to be paid within three months from the time this Resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount is to be deducted from respondent Rule V. Delicana's accrued leave credits, if any, or from the salaries corresponding to the services he rendered for the period August 23, 2019 to June 14, 2022. Any excess from the accrued salaries of respondent Ruel V. Delicana for the period August 23, 2019 to June 14, 2022 after deduction of the PHP 400,000.00 fine, shall be RELEASED to him, subject to the submission of complete and duly certified Daily Time Records for the said period, and after the same have been verified by the Office of the Court Administrator and Fiscal Management and Budget Office."
"G.R. No. 251824, April 11, 2024","PETER B. FAVILA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","The facts as summarized in Our assailed Decision are as follows:
During the period from 2008 to 2010, petitioner Peter B. Favila (Favila), who was then the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), served as an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors (Board/BOD) of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP), a government corporate entity created under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1080, as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8494.

On various occasions from 2005 to 2007, TIDCORP's BOD approved eight Board Resolutions [granting] productivity enhancement pay, developmental contribution bonuses, corporate guaranty, grocery subsidy, and anniversary bonuses to its board members and their alternates.

On July 13, 2012, without a prior notice of suspension, COA Audit Team Leader Gloria O. Lacson (ATL Lacson) and Supervising Auditor Teodora M. Lacerna (SA Lacerna) issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2012-001, disallowing various disbursement vouchers and the corresponding checks in the total amount of PHP 4,539,835.02, pertaining to monetary benefits of TIDCORP's Board members for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, on the ground that the same were not in accordance with [Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution], which pertinently reads:
8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, [...]
It was opined that the disallowed amount constitutes double compensation since the Board members received the same in an ex-officio capacity. One of the members held liable under the ND was herein petitioner Favila who allegedly received a total of PHP 454,598.28 in benefits from October 2008 to May 2010.

TIDCORP, on behalf of its implicated officers, appealed the disallowance to the Office of the Cluster Director arguing that Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 8494 expressly grants to the Board the exclusive power to fix the remuneration, emoluments, and fringe benefits of TIDCORP officers and employees. By virtue of this, the Board passed the resolutions granting the questioned monetary benefits to its members in good faith. TIDCORP further averred that COA denied the Board members of their right to due process when it proceeded with the disallowance without first issuing a Notice of Suspension.

In their Answer Memorandum, ATL Lacson and SA Lacerna argued that [Republic Act No. 8494, Sec. 7] pertains to the authority of the Board to grant benefits/bonuses to the officers and employees of TlDCORP, and not to those given to the Board of Directors, much more to its ex-officio members. Republic Act No. 8494, Sec. 13 limits the benefits that may be accorded to the members of the Board to per diem allowances only.[5]
Undaunted, Favila filed a Petition for Review[6] before the COA Proper.","The present Motion for Reconsideration[1] seeks to reverse Our November 29, 2022 Decision[2] which affirmed the Decision in Decision No. 2019-001[3] and the Resolution in Decision No. 2020-177[4] of the Commission on Audit (COA) which found petitioner Peter B. Favila liable as the approving officer and recipient of the disallowed amount of PHP 4,539,835.02.
","After a careful deliberation, We find the motion for reconsideration impressed with merit and grant the same in part. Favila is liable to return only the amount he has unduly received.

In Madera v. Commission on Audit,[20] the Court laid down a new set of rules regarding the refund of amounts disallowed by the COA, to wit:
1.
If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.



2.
If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:




a.
Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.




b.
Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only the net disallowed amount which, as discussed herein, excludes amounts excused under the following Sections 2c and 2d.




c.
Recipients - whether approving or certifying officers or mere passive recipients - are liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered.




d.
The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other bona fide exceptions as it may determine on a case to case basis.[21] (Emphasis supplied)
In the instant case, it was established that Favila was neither an approving nor a certifying officer of the subject board resolutions which granted the disallowed benefits. Records show that the subject resolutions were approved by the Board on various occasions from 2005 to 2007.[22] Meanwhile, Favila joined the TIDCORP's Board only in 2008.[23] This means that he had no participation in the approval or certification thereof. As such, a determination of whether or not he acted in good faith, with malice or gross negligence, as the approving or certifying officer under category 2 (a) and (b) of the above-cited rules on return becomes immaterial. Given his lack of participation in the grant of the disallowed benefits, petitioner cannot be held jointly and severally liable to return the entire disallowed amount of PHP 4,539,835.02.","ACCORDINGLY, the Motion for Reconsideration is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed November 29, 2022 Decision is MODIFIED in that petitioner Peter B. Favila is directed to settle only the amount of PHP 454,598.28 which he actually received as an ex-officio member of the Board of Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines."

That on or about the 3rd day of August 2018, in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually aiding and abetting one another, by means of deceit/fraud and by taking advantage of the vulnerability and dire financial needs of AAA,*  a minor of 16 years of age, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously recruit and hire, harbor and deliver, match for money &/or other consideration the said victims/persons for the purpose of sexual services, prostitution and sexual exploitation, where the said accused instruct their recruit to perform explicit sexual activities with their customer/s deriving profits from said business.

The above-named accused committed the crime with the qualifying circumstances of syndicated action, the three (3) accused working in conspiracy with each [other] participating in the offense and sharing a single criminal intent.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On arraignment, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty. The prosecution presented the testimonies of Supervising Agent Arcelito C. Albao (SA Albao), Special Investigator III Aries Soliman Manaloto (SI Manaloto), AAA, and AAA's uncle, BBB. The parties also stipulated on the testimony of Christine Anne Gatmaitan-Plasigue, the social worker who handled the victim's case and prepared a report thereon.[9] On the other hand, the defense waived its right to present evidence.[10]","This Appeal[1] seeks to reverse the Decision[2] dated November 12, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12848 affirming the conviction of accused-appellants Jeffrey Becaylas y Remon @ ""Bella"" (Becaylas), Kier Rome De Leon y Alfonso @ ""Mishe"" (De Leon), and Justine Lumanlan y Sangalang @ ""Chiee"" (Lumanlan) for Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a),[3] in relation to Section 6(a)[4] of Republic Act No. 9208,[5] as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.[6]","We affirm.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9208,[29] as amended by Republic Act No. 10364[30] defines Trafficking in Persons, to wit:
Section 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act:

 	
(a)
Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph. (Emphasis supplied.)
Trafficking in Persons requires the following elements: (1) The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (2) The means used which includes ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[31]

The crime is further qualified under Section 6[32] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, when the trafficked person is a child or when the crime is committed by a syndicate or in large scale. Trafficking is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three or more persons, individually or as a group.

Here, all the elements of qualified trafficking in persons have been established to a moral certainty by the clear, straightforward, and convincing testimony of the prosecution witnesses. Consider:

First, AAA's testimony proved that accused-appellants recruited her for the purpose of prostitution. The offense is qualified trafficking in persons because at the time accused-appellants committed the crime on August 3, 2018, AAA was only 16 years old as alleged in the Information and evidenced by her birth certificate.

AAA clearly narrated how she was recruited or hired for sexual purposes, first by De Leon, and later on, by Becaylas and Lumanlan. After meeting her, De Leon asked if she wanted money. Upon confirming that she needed money, De Leon contacted ""guests"" to meet with her. Not knowing she would be offered to them for sexual purposes in exchange for money, she accepted De Leon's offer. De Leon later introduced her to Becaylas and Lumanlan who also exploited her under the same scheme. Accused-appellants offered her for sex for a fee on 30 separate occasions, with her share ranging from PHP 2,000.00 to PHP 3,000.00 per guest.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated November 12, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12848 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants Jeffrey Becaylas y Remon @ ""Bella,"" Kier Rome De Leon y Alfonso @ ""Mishe,"" and Justine Lumanlan y Sangalang @ ""Chiee"" are found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 and sentenced to life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. They are further ordered to jointly and severally PAY AAA PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

These monetary awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid."

In Criminal Case No. 01-0029-2019, Almero was charged with violation of Section 4(k)(2) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, viz.:
Criminal Case No. 01-0029-2019

On September 30, 2018 at xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by taking advantage of the minor-complainant's vulnerability, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously recruit, procure or offer for a fee AAA* (DOB: xxxxxxxxxxx), a [14-year-old] minor, to a certain ""Carlo,"" by any means for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

Contrary to law. [3]
On arraignment, Almero pleaded not guilty to the charge.[4] The parties thereafter stipulated, among others, that: (a) AAA[5] was a 14-year-old minor at the time of the incident;[6] (b) BBB[7] is the biological mother of AAA; (c) BBB was the first person to whom AAA narrated what Almero did to her; (d) BBB assisted AAA in filing the criminal case against Almero; and (e) BBB can identify AAA's Sinumpaang Salaysay[8] dated October 11, 2018 (Sinumpaang Salaysay), as well as AAA's and her signature thereon.[9]

The parties also stipulated that Dr. Jazelle R. Quebrado (Dr. Quebrado): (a) did a medical examination of AAA at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; (b) prepared the Medico-Legal Certificate[10] dated October 9, 2018; and (c) would affirm her findings that the hymen of AAA was no longer intact.[11]","This Appeal[1] assails the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Trafficking in persons is defined under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, viz.:
SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act:

(a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Here, the charge falls under Section 4(k)(2) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, viz.:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. - It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

. . . .

(k) To recruit, transport, harbor, obtain, transfer, maintain, hire, offer, provide, adopt or receive a child for purposes of exploitation or trading them, including but not limited to, the act of baring and/or selling a child for any consideration or for barter for purposes of exploitation. Trafficking for purpose of exploitation of children shall include:
. . . .

(2) The use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography, or for pornographic performances;

. . . .
SEC 6. Qualified Trafficking in Persons. - The following are considered as qualified trafficking:

(a) When the trafficked person is a child[.] (Emphasis supplied)
People v. Casio[66] laid down the elements of trafficking in persons under the expanded definition in Republic Act No. 10364, thus:
(1) The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders"";

(2) The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""; and

(3) The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."" (Emphasis supplied)
On this score, both the trial court and the appellate court are one in finding that the elements of the offense, as well as the qualifying circumstance ""that the trafficked person is a child,"" are present here.[67]

"G.R. No. 258888, April 08, 2024","ROLANDO B. ZOLETA, PETITIONER, VS. INVESTIGATING STAFF, INTERNAL AFFAIRS BOARD, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, REPRESENTED BY: GIPO III ALFRED YANN G. OGUIS AND AGIO OMAR R. LEANO,** RESPONDENTS.","On July 21, 2017, Leonardo R. Nicolas, Jr. (Nicolas, Jr.), Associate Graft Investigation Officer III of the Intelligence Bureau-Field Investigation Office (IB-FIO) of the OMB, was arrested in an entrapment operation for extorting PHP 3,000,000.00 from Congressman Amado Espino in exchange for the closure of cases pending against Mayor Jumel Espino of Bugallon, Pangasinan. While detained in the National Bureau of Investigation Custodial Detention Center, Nicolas, Jr. executed an Affidavit dated August 2, 2017, stating that he has been transacting with petitioner Rolando B. Zoleta (Zoleta), previously the Assistant Ombudsman for Luzon then assigned at the Appeals Bureau of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in fixing cases pending for preliminary investigation in exchange for a ""tag price"" ranging from PHP 200,000.00 to PHP 300,000.00.[6]

On August 4, 2017, Alfred Yann G. Oguis (Oguis), a member of the Internal Affairs Board-Investigating Staff (IAB-IS), filed a Complaint against Zoleta and Elias B. Caputolan Jr. (Caputolan, Jr.), an employee of the OMB, with the IAB for Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service under Rule 10(A) Nos. 1 and 3 and (B) No. 8 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS),[7] and violation of Republic Act (RA) No. 6713,[8] otherwise known as the ""Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.""[9] It was alleged therein that Zoleta offered help to facilitate the dismissal of cases pending preliminary investigation and administrative adjudication before the OMB-Luzon and the OMB for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (OMB-MOLEO).[10] Attached to the Complaint was an Affidavit allegedly executed on August 2, 2017 by Nicolas, Jr. stating that starting January 2017, he began transacting with high ranking officials. Zoleta allegedly fixed the cases of Provincial Assessor Nestor Quiambao, Mayor Percival Mallare, National Labor Relations Commission Labor Arbiter Irenarco Rimando, and Police Inspector Jaojoco Cagaoan (Cagaoan).[11] Also attached to the Complaint is the Letter addressed to the OMB and signed by Nicolas, Jr., printed screenshot of the Joint Resolution in the cases involving Cagaoan, several screenshots of the messages via Short Message Service (SMS) between Nicolas, Jr. and a certain ""AO Roy Zoleta,"" and a printed screenshot of the mobile phone number of AO Roy Zoleta.[12]

In an Order dated August 7, 2017, the IAB preventively suspended Zoleta for a period of six months. In another Order of even date, Zoleta was required to submit his counter-affidavit to the Complaint. However, instead of filing a counter-affidavit, Zoleta opted to file a Manifestation indicating the length of his government service and the history of his performance ratings, including his hospitalization for ruptured aneurysm.[13] He stated that he exercised this option because the Complaint executed on August 4, 2017 by Oguis was a mere scrap of paper because it was not based on the latter's personal knowledge and it was not supported by any affidavit or sworn statement of a witness naming Zoleta as the person being alluded to.[14] On the other hand, Oguis submitted a Motion to Admit Reply/Comment[15] dated September 14, 2017 with the attached Reply/Comment and the Judicial Affidavit[16] of Nicolas, Jr. executed on August 15, 2017. Zoleta filed his Opposition to the motion, praying for the denial of the motion, the lifting of the preventive suspension and the dismissal of the administrative complaint filed against him.[17] In an Order[18] dated October 10, 2017, parties were required to submit their respective verified position papers within a non-extendible period of 10 days from receipt of the Order.

Zoleta, in his Position Paper[19] dated October 23, 2017 attached the Joint Affidavit[20] dated September 7, 2017 and the Supplemental Joint Affidavit[21] dated October 9, 2017 of Joaquin F. Salazar and Dennis L. Garcia of the OMB­-Luzon and the OMB-MOLEO, respectively. In turn, Oguis filed a Motion to Admit Position Paper[22] dated October 27, 2017 with his Position Paper.[23]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 7, 2021 and the Resolution[3] dated October 6, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 156298, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated January 17, 2018 and the Omnibus Order[5] dated May 21, 2018 of the Internal Affairs Board (IAB) of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-C-A-17-0265.","As a general rule, factual findings of the OMB are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and weight, especially when affirmed by the CA.[48] Section 27[49] of R.A. No. 6770[50] mandates that the findings of fact by the OMB are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence.

In administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings, only substantial evidence is necessary to establish the case for or against a party. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[51] In administrative proceedings, the complainant has the duty to prove by substantial evidence the allegations in their administrative complaint.[52]

In reviewing administrative decisions, it is beyond the province of this Court to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses, or otherwise substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency with respect to the sufficiency of evidence. However, while it is not the function of the Court to analyze and weigh the parties' evidence all over again, an exception thereto lies as when there is serious ground to believe that a possible miscarriage of justice would thereby result.[53] This exception is not present in this case.

Zoleta was charged with Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service – grave offenses for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even for first-time offenders.[54] The OMB found Zoleta guilty of Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal from government service with all its accessory penalties. The CA, on appeal, affirmed the ruling of the OMB.

After a careful review of the records of the case, this Court resolves to deny the Petition for Review on Certiorari. ","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED."
"G.R. No. 262362*, April 08, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JERRIE R. ARRAZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
","The prosecution avowed that it was in March 2010 when CCC[15] first met Arraz in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. At that time, she was only 12 years old and worked as a nanny and storekeeper for Arraz's cousin. Arraz told her that foreigners would like her and because of this, she felt elated. She intimated to him that she wanted to study in xxxxxxx and experience a good life. She eventually prevailed upon her parents to allow her to go with the assistance of Arraz himself. He bought her a dress and a pair of shoes and then brought her along to xxxxxxxxxxxxxx on board a ship at his own expense. She stayed in his residence at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[16]

At the start of CCC's stay in the house of Arraz, she was not permitted to leave the premises. He told her that she was ugly and that he needed to groom her. Thus, he had her skin bleached and hair fixed. He told her that he wanted her to be beautiful when they go out so she would not get bullied.[17] During this time, she was made to watch pornographic videos to learn what to do with men.[18] Later, she was enrolled in the school near Arraz's house. He bought her school uniform and supplies as well as sexy dresses and shorts.[19]

In the early morning of July 2010, Arraz woke up CCC, telling her that there was a customer who wanted her to say ""hi"" to him. They proceeded to his room and the door was closed. Inside, a foreigner was online in a Skype call and after exchanging greetings, Arraz told her that the customer also wanted her to perform a show and that she should do what the customer wanted. The customer asked Arraz to instruct her to remove her clothes, to which she acceded. She removed all her garments and stood in front of the web camera. She was asked to pose nude and to smile while the foreigner got naked and started playing with his own organ. She testified that she wanted to cry at that time, but she convinced herself not to do so. She never imagined that she would be subjected to such kind of treatment.[20]

On another occasion in July 2010, CCC was again awoken by Arraz and informed her that a foreigner would be sending money. She and Arraz proceeded to the latter's room where another foreigner was watching them online. Arraz placed a towel on the floor and made her lie down. After they were both undressed, Arraz ordered her to get up to suck his penis. After that, she was made to lie down again and then he inserted his penis into her vagina, which caused her pain. When he was about to ejaculate, Arraz inserted his penis into her mouth and released his sperm. Throughout the ordeal, the foreigner was masturbating while watching them.[21]

Similar incidents transpired thereafter. Foreigners would send money to Arraz and he would often inform CCC about this whenever he bought her needs for school and gave her an allowance.[22]","This ordinary appeal[1] before the Court seeks to overturn the Decision (Modified Version)[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) finding accused-appellant Jerrie R. Arraz (Arraz) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of: (1) five counts of qualified trafficking in persons, as defined and penalized under Section 4(a) and (e), in relation to Section 3(a), (b), (c), (h), and (j), as well as Sections 6(a) and 10(e), of Republic Act No. 9208,[3] as amended by Republic Act No. 10364;[4] and (2) three counts of rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.[5]
Arraz was inculpated for the crimes of qualified trafficking in persons and rape across eight separate Informations, all raffled to Branch xx of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City and docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00611-CR to R-QZN-15-00618-CR.[6] The Informations read:","The appeal is denied for lack of merit.

Preliminarily, the Court refuses to pander to Arraz's postulation that his right to due process was violated owing to the lack of specificity as to the date of the commission of the offenses charged in the Informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00611-CR to R-QZN-15-00618-CR. It is well-settled that in crimes where the date of commission is not a material element, as in this case, it is not necessary to allege such date with absolute specificity or certainty in the information.[73] The Rules of Court merely requires that the date of commission be approximated,[74] as in the case at bench. Certainly, the CA committed no reversible error in ratiocinating that the countless abuses suffered by private complainants undoubtedly impaired their capability to provide an exact recollection of when the incidents occurred, especially when the abuses spanned several months and years.[75] The Court finds and so holds that the approximate dates indicated on the Informations were sufficient to apprise Arraz of the particular offenses charged. In any case, any defects on the lack of specificity of the dates of commission of the offenses were deemed waived on account of Arraz's failure to raise the same before he entered his non-guilty plea.[76] As borne by the records, Arraz moved to quash only the Informations pertaining to Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00615-CR, R-QZN-15-00616-CR, and R-QZN-15-00618-CR on the sole ground that the acts complained of in these cases were purportedly committed prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 10364.[77] However, there was no move to quash any of the Informations on the ground of lack of specificity of the dates of the commission of the offenses charged therein.

On the substantive issues, the Court gives its imprimatur to the finding of the CA that Arraz's guilt for the crimes charged were proven beyond reasonable doubt. It bears stressing that ""the factual findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses, and its conclusions based on its findings are generally binding and conclusive upon the Court, especially so when affirmed by the appellate court.""[78] Indeed, the foregoing principle is only strengthened by the Court's own independent and perspicacious review of the records of this case.

Arraz is guilty of qualified trafficking in persons in Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN- 15-00611-CR, R-QZN-15-00612-CR, R-QZN-15-00615-CR, R-QZN-15- 00616-CR, and R-QZN-15-00618-CR.

"A.C. No. 10627 (from A.C. No. 6622), April 03, 2024","RENO R. GONZALES, JR. AND ROBIN BRYAN F. CONCEPCION, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTYS. SOCRATES RIVERA AND CRES DAN BANGOY, RESPONDENTS.","In the July 10, 2012 Decision[3] in Villatuya v. Atty. Tabalingcos, the Court disbarred Atty. Bede S. Tabalingcos (Tabalingcos) for engaging in Bigamy. Thereafter, the Court denied with finality Tabalingcos's Motion for Reconsideration in a Resolution dated August 28, 2012. Records revealed that Tabalingcos received a copy of the said Resolution on October 2, 2012.[4] Despite his disbarment, however, it appears that Tabalingcos continued to perform acts that constituted the practice of law, specifically by filing, among others, motions for extension dated September 18, 2012 and October 18, 2012 in an administrative case before the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), docketed as OSI-AC No. 2012-027 (BSP case). Thus, complainants filed the letter-request informing the Court of Tabalingcos's actions.[5] They likewise requested the Court to investigate respondents, Tabalingcos's partners and associates, for possible violation of Canon 9[6] of the CPR for allegedly assisting Tabalingcos, directly or indirectly, in his unauthorized practice of law.[7]

With respect to respondents, complainants particularly alleged that Bangoy, together with Tabalingcos, signed as counsel under the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office the Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum[8] dated October 18, 2012 filed in the BSP case, despite the latter's disbarment. Rivera, on the other hand, signed the Notice of Change of Address[9] dated December 2, 2013 as co-counsel of Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office in the same BSP case.[10] Moreover, complainants asserted that by respondents' act of signing the pleadings on behalf of the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office, they misrepresented to the public that Tabalingcos was still authorized to practice law.[11]

In the said Resolution[12] dated August 19, 2014 issued by the Court in A.C. No. 6622, the Court found Tabalingcos guilty of unauthorized practice of law. The Court also treated complainants' letter-request as a complaint against respondents which was subsequently docketed as A.C. No. 10627. Thereafter, in Resolution[13] dated December 3, 2014, the Court required respondents to file their respective comments.

In compliance, Bangoy filed his Comment[14] dated November 4, 2014 claiming that he was no longer an associate of Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office upon the finality of Tabalingcos's disbarment in October 2012. He explained that he left the law firm in August 2012 to establish his own law office ""because of the Decision of the [Court] x x x in July 2012 Decision""[15] that disbarred Tabalingcos. Moreover, he denied any knowledge or participation in: (a) Tabalingcos's unauthorized practice of law; (b) the cases Tabalingcos allegedly appeared as a counsel; and (c) the pleadings Tabalingcos purportedly signed. He thus, prayed that the case against him be dismissed for lack of merit.[16] For his part, Rivera failed to file his comment.

In their Reply,[17] complainants argued that Bangoy's defense is self-serving considering his failure to present any evidence with respect to his separation from the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office, as well as his alleged independent practice. Further, they pointed out that the Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum signed by Bangoy in the BSP case was in fact filed two months after the latter learned of Tabalingcos's disbarment. For respondents, Bangoy's signature in said motion was a confirmation that: (i) he was still a practicing member of the law firm; (ii) he knew about the BSP case; (iii) he knew of Tabalingcos's continued unlawful practice of law; and (iv) he knew of the continuous use of his name by Tabalingcos's law firm.[18] Finally, they averred that Rivera's failure to comment was an implied admission of his knowledge and consent to Tabalingcos's unauthorized practice of law.[19]

Thereafter, in view of Rivera's failure to file his comment, the Court issued a Resolution[20] dated July 30, 2018 requiring him to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt. This notwithstanding, Rivera still failed to file his comment and/or comply with the show cause Resolution. Thus, the Court issued a Resolution[21] dated November 9, 2020: (1) imposing upon Rivera a fine of PHP 1,000.00 payable to the Court within 10 days from notice, or imprisonment of five days if the fine is not paid within said period; and (2) requiring him to comply with the Court's directive to file his comment. To this date, Rivera has yet to comply with these directives; thus, the fine imposed in the November 9, 2020 Resolution stands.

Thereafter, the Court referred to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) for appropriate action the failure of Rivera to pay the fine and file his comment as ordered by the Court.[22]","The instant administrative case stemmed from the Resolution[1] dated August 19, 2014 issued by the Court in A.C. No. 6622, entitled ""Manuel G. Villatuya v. Atty. Bede S. Tabalingcos (Villatuya v. Atty. Tabalingcos)"", which, among others, treated the Letter-Request[2] dated May 8, 2014 filed by complainants Reno R. Gonzales, Jr. and Bryan F. Concepcion (complainants) of Tan Venturaza and Valdez Law Office as a Complaint against respondents Attys. Socrates Rivera (Rivera) and Cres Dan Bangoy (Bangoy; collectively, respondents) for violation of Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).","The Court resolves to: (a) adopt the findings and recommendation of the OBC with respect to Rivera's failure to pay the fine and file his comment, with modification; and (b) hold Bangoy administratively liable for assisting in unauthorized practice of law, as will be further discussed hereunder.

I.

At the outset, it is important to note that on April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC or the ""Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability"" (CPRA), repealing the CPR, Sections 20 to 37 of Rule 138, and Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. Section 3 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall take effect 15 calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazette or any newspaper of general circulation."" The CPRA was published in the Philippine Star and Manila Bulletin on May 14, 2023 and hence, already effective on May 30, 2023.[27]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondents Socrates Rivera and Atty. Cres Dan Bangoy GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. They are hereby meted the following penalty:

(a)
As for Rivera, he is hereby FINED in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.
 	 

Further, the ORDER issued by the Court in the Resolution dated November 9, 2020 directing Rivera to PAY the fine in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 stands.
 	 
(b)
As for Atty. Bangoy, he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six months effective immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Further, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.
The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Atty.

After completing his suspension, Atty. Bangoy shall file with the Office of the Bar Confidant a Sworn Statement pursuant to Section 45 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability."
"G.R. No. 234849, April 03, 2024","SAN MIGUEL FOODS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES RAMON AND MA. NELIA FABIE, AND FRESH LINK, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Based on the lone testimony of respondent Nelia Fabie, on October 27, 1992, Fresh Link entered into a Complementary Distributorship Agreement with SMFI under which Fresh Link was appointed as the exclusive distributor of SMFI products to specific territories or accounts for a period of six months. Under the contract, Fresh Link was required to guarantee payment for its purchases of SMFI products subject to sale and distribution. Initially, respondent spouses offered their house and lot as collateral to guarantee payment for their purchases under the contract. This was later replaced by postdated checks and a credit line under a Credit Line Agreement for PHP 800,000.00 worth of purchases extended by SMFI to Fresh Link, which was secured by a standby letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of SMFI. Since October 1992, the contract has been renewed or extended yearly under the same terms and conditions, including the rights and obligations of the parties.[8]

On May 15, 1998, the contract was once again renewed for a period of one year from May 1, 1998, pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement on Complementary Distributorship. The renewed contract substantially provided the same obligations for SMFI as the previous agreement, particularly: (a) maintaining the exclusivity of the distributorship agreement by not selling or offering for sale any of the specified products to any person or persons within the geographic territory assigned to Fresh Link other than the latter; and (b) using its best endeavors to safeguard the sale and exclusive rights granted to Fresh Link. Under the renewed contract, the geographic territory or account assigned to Fresh Link was Makati (except for talipapas or stalls located in Kalayaan, Sacramento, Pio del Pilar, Tejeros, and Bangkal) and the Guadalupe Wet Market.[9]

In April 1999, the parties once again renewed the Complementary Distributorship Agreement (Agreement) for another period, which will expire on March 31, 2000. Meanwhile, the Credit Line Agreement in favor of Fresh Link remained in effect and subsisting until March 31, 2000. Although the respondents signed the Agreement with SMFI, and the latter executed a Credit Line Agreement in favor of Fresh Link, respondents alleged that they were not given a copy of the Agreement. Respondents requested from SMFI a copy of the said contract since it was needed for the release of the Irrevocable Domestic Standby Letter of Credit to be issued by the Bank of the Philippines Islands (BPI) in favor of SMFI as a guarantee for the Credit Line Agreement. However, respondents' request was supposedly not acted upon by SMFI or any of its officers.[10]

On June 2, 1999, and June 3, 1999, respondents complained to SMFI regarding the supposed withholding of discounts or rebates due to them, the proliferation of Magnolia chicken in the wet market within their assigned geographic territory at prices lower than the invoice price given to them, and SMFI's refusal to furnish them with a copy of the renewed Agreement. Thereafter, on June 4, 1999, SMFI ceased delivery of its products on credit to Fresh Link.[11] This action constrained respondents to file the instant Complaint against SMFI.

For its part, SMFI presented four of its officers as witnesses: Alvin Tabbu, Account Receivables Head; Oscar Caronongan, IT Head; Eugene de la Paz, Business Development Officer; and Alandro del Rosario, Area Sales Manager.[12]

In addition to refuting the allegations made by respondent Nelia Fabie, SMFI claimed that Fresh Link made numerous purchases from SMFI between March 23, 1999, and subsequent dates. It is noteworthy that, according to the Agreement, Fresh Link had a 30-day period from the date of purchase to settle its accounts with SMFI, totaling PHP 1,899,645.97, which, according to SMFI, had already become due and payable. Despite repeated demands from SMFI, Fresh Link supposedly failed to fulfill its obligations. Furthermore, contrary to the assertions of respondent Nelia Fabie, SMFI pointed out that the collateral provided by Fresh Link in the form of a letter of credit had expired on May 31, 1999.[13] Hence, on June 4, 1999, SMFI argued that it was compelled to deliver products to Fresh Link only upon receipt of cash payment.[14]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner San Miguel Foods, Inc. (SMFI) seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 104501, which affirmed with modifications the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 59, Makati City in Civil Case No. 99-1147. The Resolution of the CA denied SMFI's Motion for Reconsideration.[6]
The Antecedents

The instant petition arose from a Complaint for Breach of Contract and Damages with Prayer for [a] Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction[7] filed by respondent Fresh Link, Inc. (Fresh Link), a corporation owned by respondent spouses Ramon and Nelia Fabie, against SMFI, and Alandro del Rosario and Eugene De la Paz, Area Sales Manager and Business Development Officer, respectively, of SMFI.","After a judicious deliberation, We find the Petition meritorious.

The Court can conduct its own factual findings if there is insufficient evidence or if the parties failed to substantiate their claims
In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish its cause of action by a preponderance of evidence,[31] or that ""evidence which is of greater weight or is more convincing than that which is in opposition to it.""[32] Preponderance of evidence ""does not mean absolute truth; rather, it means that the testimony of one side is more believable than that of the other side, and that the probability of truth is on one side than on the other.""[33]

A determination of where the preponderance of evidence lies constitutes a factual matter, which, as a rule, cannot be considered in a Rule 45 petition.[34] This is because the Court is not a trier of facts; the function of the Court in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including instances where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise, and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (5) the findings of fact are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by evidence on record.[35]

Here, the lower courts' decisions rest heavily on the testimony of one witness, namely Nelia Fabie. Thus, this Court will embark on its own factual analysis and will, if necessary, reverse the rulings of the lower courts if the facts of the case suggest a lack or absence of evidence consistent with the fifth exception cited above, or if it finds that respondents in this case have failed to substantiate their claims by preponderance of evidence and, thus, are not entitled to the award of damages.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The May 18, 2017 Decision and the October 18, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104501 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint for Breach of Contract and Damages filed by respondents Spouses Ramon and Ma. Nelia Fabie and Fresh Link, Inc. against petitioner San Miguel Foods, Inc. is DISMISSED for lack of merit."
"G.R. No. 225920, April 03, 2024","FELIMON C. TORRES, PETITIONER, VS. BOARD OF TRUSTEES, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM; HOUSING FINANCE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT AND COMMITTEE ON CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, RESPONDENTS.","The facts of this case as culled from the records are undisputed.

Second Lieutenant Dominador dela Cena Torres, Jr. (Dominador) was an active combat pilot who flew the rotary aircraft for the Philippine Air Force (PAF).[5] In 1979, while he was still in active service, he entered into a Deed of Conditional Sale (DCS) with ARB Construction Co., Inc. (ARB) over a piece of real property, a low-cost housing unit, located at Block 56, Lot 4, Soldiers' Hills Village, Muntinlupa City (subject property) for the price of PHP76,830.00, to be financed by a secured housing loan from the GSIS which, in turn, was payable through salary deductions.[6]

Tragedy struck when less than a year after Dominador took out the housing loan, while he was performing a ferry mission in Mindanao on September 2, 1980, the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Lanao del Sur, killing him, two of his gunners, and four rebel returnees, with said crash being ruled by the LOA Status Board of the PAF as ""purely accidental.""[7] Dominador died intestate, single and without issue.[8] He was survived by his parents, Dominador Briones Torres, Sr. and Independencia dela Cena Torres. When Dominador's father and mother subsequently died on June 6, 1986 and April 30, 1997, respectively, they, in turn, were survived by Dominador's sibling, herein petitioner.

Yet uninformed of Dominador's death, the GSIS sent Dominador's last address several letters regarding his amortizations on his housing loan and as they remained unanswered, GSIS sent him a Notice of Foreclosure/Cancellation, which informed that it would undertake foreclosure proceedings on all low-cost housing loan accounts which were considered delinquent.[9]

Exchanges between the GSIS and petitioner later ensued. Specifically, on December 12, 1988 the GSIS Quezon City Branch Office 1 – Military sent a Notice of Foreclosure of Dominador's DCS for failure to pay installments thereon.[10] Petitioner, through letters dated February 23 and April 17, 1989,[11] and November 14, 1990[12] countered that the ownership over the subject property should be consolidated in his name for the reason that by virtue of the Sales Redemption Insurance (SRI) policy of the GSIS, the monthly amortizations for the subject property are deemed waived, since premiums therefor had already been deducted from Dominador's salary and paid for.[13]

Despite petitioner's claims, the GSIS sent on February 28, 2003 a letter anew to Dominador, reminding the latter of the need to settle the outstanding obligations, to which petitioner also reiterated his earlier claim. On July 14, 2003,[14] the GSIS also countered that Dominador's DCS was not covered by the SRI policy since Dominador, during his lifetime, did not submit himself to the requisite physical and medical examinations for the securing of the same and, consequently, it became incumbent upon Dominador's heirs to satisfy the outstanding monthly amortizations for the subject property.[15]

Still, 25 years after Dominador's tragic death, or on September 15, 2005,[16] the GSIS maintained its denial of petitioner's claims and finally issued a Notice of Cancellation of the DCS of the subject property, as well as a final demand upon the occupants of the same to vacate therefrom. [17]

Petitioner filed a petition before the GSIS Board on February 3, 2006, docketed as GSIS Case No. 002-06, and sought that the title over the subject property be consolidated in his name.[18] Petitioner also prayed that in the event that the claim was denied and that he be required to pay, that the basis of payment be the original purchase price stated in the DCS.[19]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] (assailed Decision) dated March 16, 2016, and the Resolution[3] (assailed Resolution) dated July 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals Eleventh Division (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 136562. The assailed Decision, and the assailed Resolution dismissed the appeal lodged by herein petitioner Felimon C. Torres (petitioner) and affirmed the Decision[4] of respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Board of Trustees (GSIS Board) dated March 8, 2012 in GSIS Case No. 002-06 which, in turn, dismissed petitioner's petition therein.

This case is set against the factual backdrop of a military pilot who died in the line of duty, and whose abrupt passing resulted in unpaid amortizations which now endanger the right of his heir to the socialized housing he worked to secure during his brief lifetime. Within this milieu, the Court seizes the opportunity to study more closely how justice can be discerned and served within the dispassionate confines of the law, and give life to the mandate of a socialized institution with rules that work to further and not frustrate its first purpose. As well, the Court here reminds that the duties of good faith in contracts do not have shallow roots but, instead, underpin the precisely defined duties and obligations that color the way we must relate to one another within the contractual sphere. So that contractual good faith is not so much a superimposed duty on the parties in the event of dispute, but is instead unearthed to be its irreducible core.
","The Court here is presented with a two-part issue for resolution: whether Dominador's DCS was covered by the SRI and, consequently, whether the cancellation of the DCS was warranted by virtue of non-payment of amortizations.

The Court approaches the instant issue with the clear applicability of the pertinent and unambiguous GSIS issuances set within the larger context of the purpose and mandate of the GSIS and largest framework of equity and justice.

Proceeding therefrom, the Court here finds that while the GSIS Board is correct in ruling that Dominador's DCS is not covered by the SRI, the cancellation of the DCS and the demand for petitioner and the occupants of the subject property to vacate are, nevertheless, unwarranted. Instead, in view of GSIS Resolution No. 48 and in the interest of justice, petitioner, as the sole heir of Dominador, must be allowed to avail of a restructuring of the outstanding amortizations due on Dominador's housing loan account, so that he and whoever may be occupying the subject property on account of said DCS be secured in their occupation of the same.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated March 16, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals Eleventh Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 136562 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to respondent GSIS Board of Trustees for determination of the loan payment restructuring pursuant to PPG No. 232-13 and related remedies as may be proper in favor of herein petitioner Felimon C. Torres for the full payment of the outstanding obligations of the subject housing loan account in the name of Dominador C. Torres, Jr. in GSIS Case No. 002-06.

(CORPS) assigned to Tarlac and Cabanatuan City.[8] Their respective hiring dates and salaries were as follows:Petitioners averred that CORPS underpaid them and certain amounts were being deducted from their salaries, as follows: (a) PHP 200.00 to PHP 1,000.00 per month for trust fund savings; and (b) PHP 200.00 per month as cash bond. During the entire period of their employment with CORPS, petitioners alleged that they were required to work every day, including regular and special holidays and their scheduled rest days. They were required to be on duty for 12 hours a day. Despite the foregoing, petitioners claim that they did not receive regular or special holiday pay, rest day pay, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, and Emergency Cost of Living Allowance (ECOLA) from CORPS.[11]

Due to these grievances, sometime in January 2015, petitioners filed a Request for Assistance (RFA) with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) – National Conciliation Mediation Board (NCMB) through the Single-Entry Approach (SEnA). In their RFA, petitioners cited monetary claims consisting of nonpayment/underpayment of wages, overtime pay, service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG contributions.[12]

During the conciliation-mediation conference conducted on March 3, 2015 before the NCMB, CORPS offered to pay petitioners their trust fund savings and cash bonds. CORPS' representative, Benjamin Sesgundo (Sesgundo), offered to petitioners the checks representing such payments, but they refused to accept them and to sign the quitclaims and release as they demanded to be paid the rest of their money claims. Sesgundo informed CORPS management of petitioners' demands.[13]

In another conciliation-mediation conference held on March 10, 2015, CORPS, through Sesgundo, asked petitioners to submit their signed resignation letters before the checks, which they were told would cover all their claims, were distributed to them. Relying on Sesgundo's assurances that the new checks covered all their money claims, petitioners submitted their signed resignation letters. Petitioners were also made to sign separate quitclaims antedated to March 3, 2015. Thereafter, CORPS, through Sesgundo, distributed the checks.[14]

Upon receipt of the checks, petitioners realized that they were the same checks that Sesgundo had offered to them on March 3, 2015, which only covered the amounts of their trust fund savings and cash bond. They insisted on returning the checks but were convinced by CORPS that the checks for the other money claims would follow as the company was still in the process of validating and reconciling their monetary claims with company records.[15] This was reflected in the Minutes of Proceedings[16] taken during the March 1, 2015 conciliation-mediation conference, to wit:

The management received the LBC letter from the requesting parties & the same will be validated (DTR) with company records w/in this month of March. . . . and will wait for R3 & other claims to be reconciled by mgt.[17]

Petitioners alleged that it was only due to these assurances that they agreed to accept the checks from CORPS in payment or as refund of their trust fund savings and cash bond.[18] Petitioners attempted to report for work the following day, but they were prevented from doing so by their supervisors as they had already supposedly resigned. By the end of March 2015, CORPS still did not pay petitioners' money claims as promised, and petitioners were still not allowed to report for duty.[19]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Consolidated Decision[2] dated February 15, 2018 and the Consolidated Resolution[3] dated November 8, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 144925 and CA-G.R. SP No. 145329. The CA ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not commit grave abuse of discretion in its Resolutions dated December 29, 2015[4] and February 24, 2016[5] in NCR Case No. 04-04334-13[6] and NCR Case No. 05-06076-15 (LAC No. 10-002857-15) when it reversed the Labor Arbiter's (LA) Decision[7] dated August 28, 2015. The NLRC held that petitioners had no intention to resign but, at the same time, were not illegally dismissed and remanded the case to the LA for the determination of petitioners' money claims.","The Petition is meritorious.

I.

Case law instructs that there is forum shopping when the following elements are established: (a) identity of the patties or at least such parties who represent the same interests in both actions; (b) identity of the rights asserted and the relief prayed for, such relief being founded on the same circumstances; and (c) identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration, said requisites likewise constitutive of the elements of litis pendentia.[57]

The third element is wanting in this case. As correctly ruled by the CA, conciliation-mediation proceedings is a mandatory prerequisite for filing a labor complaint with the NLRC. The Labor Code, as amended by RA 10396, states:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

[G.R. No. 206321]

SLIMMERS WORLD INTERNATIONAL, ALBERT CUESTA, AND DINAH QUINTO, PETITIONERS, VS. MIGUEL KIM, RESPONDENT.
","On April 8, 1991, Adelaida, then 50 years old, became a lifetime member of Slimmers World. Nine years later, in June 2000, she availed of the fitness center's biometrics program or the 12-visit personal training program with Cuesta as her personal trainer. In the morning of July 25, 2000, Adelaida went for her last session with Cuesta.[6]

After her workout and while still within the premises, Adelaida complained of headache, nausea, and discomfort. The gym staff took her blood pressure which yielded a high result. Thus, she took her medication for hypertension. As she was changing her clothes, she vomited. Consequently, the gym staff brought her to Our Lady of Grace Hospital (OLGH) in a tricycle. At 9:33 a.m., the attending physician diagnosed her to be suffering from essential hypertension.[7]

At 12:50 p.m. of the same day, Adelaida was transferred to the Chinese General Hospital (CGH), which was equipped with more advanced facilities for better monitoring. There, she immediately underwent a CT scan which revealed a mass in her brain. The doctors informed Miguel that they could no longer do anything. Three days later, or on July 28, 2000, Adelaida died due to cerebral hemorrhage and severe hypertension.[8]

On October 17, 2000, Miguel sent a letter to Slimmers World, Cuesta, and Quinto demanding the payment of damages as their negligence caused the death of his wife. When they denied liability, Miguel filed a Complaint before the RTC on November 28, 2000.[9] In their Answer, Slimmers World, Cuesta, and Quinto insisted that Adelaida's concealment of her hypertension and their observance of proper procedure in medical emergencies absolved them from liability.[10]","Adelaida, then 59 years old, availed of the 12-visit personal training program of a fitness center. Shortly after her workout on her 12th session, she complained of a headache and vomited. The gym staff immediately brought her to the hospital. After three days, she died. Her husband, Miguel, is now suing the fitness center for damages.

Before the Court are two consolidated petitions for review on certiorari[1] under Rule 45, Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding Slimmers World International (Slimmers World), Albert Cuesta (Cuesta), and Dinah Quinto (Quinto) negligent in their operation of a fitness center and thus liable for damages resulting from the death of their client, Adelaida Kim (Adelaida), wife of Miguel Kim (Miguel).

Slimmers World, operated by Behavior Modification Inc., is a Philippine corporation engaged in the business of managing a chain of fitness centers. Cuesta was employed as its fitness trainer while Quinto was its managing director.[5]","The Court, however, cannot fully adopt these assumptions as a more thorough examination of the case records controverts the same. In the first place, in his own Pre-Trial Brief,[58] Miguel expressly averred that Adelaida complained of a headache after her exercises.[59] Second, Adelaida's friend, Ms. Rabaca, who was not at the fitness center that day, testified that before Adelaida went to the gym, Adelaida called her before 7:00 a.m. to ask if she was attending the session. Hence, it cannot be concluded that Adelaida complained of a headache as early as 6:30 a.m. as she was not at the gym yet before 7:00 a.m.[60] Third, Buenavista testified to the sequence of events as follows:
Q:
Can you tell us what area of Slimmers' World International, Caloocan Branch were you particularly in, Mr. Witness?
A:
We were in the weights area, ma'am.
Q:
And how about Mr. Cuesta?
A:
He was also there, ma'am.
Q:
And since you were very near Mr. Cuesta and Mrs. Kim, did you see what particular activities were done by Mrs. Kim at that time?
A:
A: Before they started the workout they do the warm up exercises first before they do the resistance exercises, ma'am and after that when Albert Cuesta asked me to assist him they were doing the shoulder exercise using dumbbells, I think it is very light dumbbell.
Q:
Do you remember what type of warm-up exercises they did?
A:
First they do the bike exercises for five minutes and after that they do the stretching exercise and body exercises, ma'am.
Q:
When they were exercising, did you notice the appearance of Mrs. Kim?
A:
Before they actually started Albert Cuesta asked her if she is doing okay, if she is doing fine. Usually before we start the exercising we check the general appearance of the client.
Q:
So before a client starts exercising, it is part of your responsibility to assess the condition of the client?
A:
We have to check the general appearance if she is feeling well, ma'am.
Q:
And at that time did you notice anything unusual about Mrs. Kim?
A:
No. ma'am.
Q:
What happened next?
A:
After that I asked Mr. Albert Cuesta about Mrs. Kim and he told me that they are in the reception area.
Q:
And after that?
A:
Mr. Albert Cuesta asked me to check on Mrs. Kim and when I arrived at the reception area two of my colleagues/co-workers Flor and Judith were checking on her blood pressure, ma'am.
Q:
So at that time when you checked on Mrs. Kim what did she tell you or what did you do, did you ask if she is feeling good?
A:
I asked her if she is feeling well at that time and then she told me ""masakit ang ulo ko"", that is what she said ma'am.
Q:
And after she said that, what did you do?
A:
I told Flor Galang that we should bring her to the doctor because I think that is an emergency situation, so I asked them that she should bring her to the hospital, ma'am.
Q:
Were you able to bring her to the hospital?
A:
That moment no, ma'am.
Q:
Why?
A:
Because Mrs. Kim refused to be brought to the hospital, ma'am.
Q:
And do you know the reason why she refused to be brought to the hospital?
A:
She told us that she's gonna be fine after a while, ma'am.[61] (Emphasis supplied)
Based on Buenavista's recollection above, it is clear that before Adelaida began exercising, he did not observe anything unusual about her nor did he hear any complaints. When Adelaida started exercising, she was in the weights section doing shoulder exercises, bike excercises for five minutes, then stretching and body exercises. After the exercises, Adelaida moved to the reception area where Buenavista asked her if she was feeling well, to which she replied, ""masakit ang ulo ko.""[62]

Accordingly, Adelaida had no complaints before she began her exercises. The moment she complained of a headache, the gym staff told her to sit on a couch, took her blood pressure, asked her if she had any medications and if so, told her to take them, and convinced her to be brought to a hospital.[63] Hence, regardless of the inconsistency in Buenavista's recollection of the precise time of events, he remained firm in his testimony that Adelaida's complaint came after she began her workout.

Against the findings of negligence, moreover, records show that Slimmers World et al. necessary precautions given the circumstances.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court resolves to:

","The precursor facts are undisputed.

G.R. No. 219421 is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the BCDA, which fulminates against the Decision[2] of the CA in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490. The impugned Decision reversed the Order[3] of Branch 6 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, which confirmed the Final Award[4] of the tribunal in an arbitration case between the BCDA and CJH DevCo.

In the petition, CJH DevCo was impleaded as one of the respondents along with Cap-John Hay Trade and Cultural Center, Inc., Camp John Hay Golf Club, Inc. (CJH Golf), Creative Era Limited (Creative Era), Francor, Inc., Makati Foundry, Inc., V. R. Gonzalez Credit Enterprises, Inc., Norman R. Agojo, Ruben A. Alcober, Melinda T. Alcober and Ryan Joseph T.

The BCDA was formed under Republic Act No. 7227.[5] One of its primary purposes was to own, hold and/or administer several former military reservations held by the United States of America. This includes the 695-hectare property in Camp John Hay, Baguio City.[6]

Under the same Act, the BCDA was created to implement the government's policy to accelerate the sound and balanced conversion of former US military bases into alternative productive uses and enhance the benefits derived therefrom to promote the nation's economic and social development.[7]

Whence, Camp John Hay was transformed into the 625-hectare John Hay Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ). Thereupon, the BCDA publicly bid out the lease of a 247-hectare portion of the JHSEZ (leased property), including existing improvements for the development of a family-oriented public tourism complex, multiple-use forest watershed, and human resource development center.[8] The project was eventually awarded to CJH DevCo, the consortium which formed the joint venture.

Ensuingly, the BCDA, as lessor, and Fil-Estate Management, Inc., Penta Capital Investment Corporation, and CJH DevCo, as lessees, entered into a Lease Agreement[9] on October 19, 1996 (1996 Lease Agreement) for the use, management, and operation of the leased property.[10] The BCDA remained the owner of the 247-hectare portion while ownership of the improvements the CJH DevCo introduced thereon pertained to the latter. Nevertheless, CJH DevCo had the obligation to transfer ownership of the said improvements to BCDA at the end of the lease agreement.[11] Likewise, the BCDA authorized CJH DevCo to sublease the property to third persons.[12]","At the maelstrom of these consolidated Petitions are the actions of the Court of Appeals (CA) and the Commission on Audit (COA) in relation to the arbitration proceedings freely entered between the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and CJH Development Corporation (CJH DevCo).

The precursor facts are undisputed.

G.R. No. 219421 is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the BCDA, which fulminates against the Decision[2] of the CA in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490. The impugned Decision reversed the Order[3] of Branch 6 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, which confirmed the Final Award[4] of the tribunal in an arbitration case between the BCDA and CJH DevCo.
","The Court finds merit in the Petition for Review on Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 219421.

Conversely, given CJH DevCo's failure to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA, the Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 241772 ought to be dismissed.

In the case at bench, it remains irrefutable that the Final Award has become final and executory. In actual fact, the BCDA and CJH DevCo filed their respective petitions for confirmation thereof. Both were in accord that the arbitral award is conclusive and binding upon them, determinative of their rights and interests.

CJH DevCo attached to its petition for confirmation a list of ""sub-­lessees, sub-locators, and other third parties who, in good faith, acquired vested rights in the leased property."" The RTC confirmed the Final Award in its entirety and issued the requisite Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate, which included the sub-lessees occupying the leased premises.

During the pre-execution conference before the RTC, however, CJH DevCo filed an Omnibus Motion to exclude the sub-lessees from the enforcement of the February 11, 2015 Final Award, the April 4, 2015 Writ of Execution and the April 20, 2015 Notice to Vacate.

The controversy arose when CJH DevCo filed before the CA a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition (With Urgent Applications for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or a Writ of Preliminary Injunction)[45] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in order to assail the Writ of Execution and the Notice to Vacate issued by the RTC, without waiting for the RTC to decide on the Omnibus Motion. To recapitulate, CJH DevCo asserted that the trial court, the ex-officio sheriff, and the sheriff committed grave abuse of discretion when they included the sub-lessees—who were not parties to the arbitration proceedings—in enforcing the arbitral award. CJH DevCo likewise maintained that there was no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to it considering that at the time it filed the certiorari petition before the CA, the Notice to Vacate was about to be implemented without the RTC making a definite ruling on the following issues: one, whether the arbitral tribunal is binding on the sub-lessees; and two, whether it should vacate the property without the BCDA performing its obligation of returning the rent it already paid.[46] Subsequently, the petition was granted by the appellate court.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court rules as follows:

In G.R. No. 219421, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The July 30, 2015 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490 is REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The March 27, 2015 Order of Branch 6, Regional Trial Court of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, confirming the Final Award dated February 11, 2015 in PDRCI Case No. 60-2012 is REINSTATED. The April 14, 2015 Writ of Execution and the Ex-Officio Sheriff's Notice to Vacate are likewise REINSTATED.

In G.R. No. 241772, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The September 27, 2017 Decision No. 2017-312 of the Commission on Audit in COA CP Case No. 2015-610 is AFFIRMED.

"A.M. No. RTJ-16-2424 [Formerly A.M. No. 15-12-390-RTC], April 03, 2024","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, PETITIONER, VS. HON. GLOBERT J. JUSTALERO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 32, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC) OF ILOILO CITY, AND THE DESIGNATED ASSISTING JUDGE OF BRANCH 66, RTC OF BAROTAC VIEJO, ILOILO, RESPONDENT.","To recall, Judge Justalero, as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32 of Iloilo City and the designated Assisting Judge of Branch 66, RTC of Barotac Viejo, Province of Iloilo, was declared guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct. Specifically, this Court observed him to have committed the following infractions:
(1)
Judge Justalero resolved nullity cases in violation of Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 02-11-10-SC, or the rules of procedure and basic guidelines for ensuring that cases initiated to declare the nullity of marriage or to annul a marriage are insulated from vice and fraud, by:




(a)
ruling on petitions for nullity of marriage on the merits, despite the lack of jurisdiction of the RTC, Branch 66, Barotac Viejo over it;[9]




(b)
brushing aside the Office of the Solicitor General's Motion for Reconsideration despite its non-receipt of a copy of the petition for declaration of nullity of void marriages and other documents;[10]




(c)
granting the motion to serve summons by publication after the actual dates of publication;[11]




(d)
ordering the conduct of investigation of collusion even before the return of service of summons;[12]




(d)
ruling on and admitting the formal offer of evidence of petitioner on the day of its filing, without awaiting the prosecutor's comment or objection thereto within the period given to interpose it;[13] and




(e)
disregarding incidents where: (i) the sheriffs return of service stated that summons was served on respondent when there is no actual proof of receipt of summons; and (ii) the collusion report was issued only three days from the issuance of the order directing the conduct of an investigation.[14]



(2)
Judge Justalero violated A.M. No. 08-7-429-RTC and Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 12-2010 by solemnizing marriages that were not raffled to his sala but were only referred to him by Judge Amador.[15]



(3)
Judge Justalero notarized affidavits of cohabitation of the parties whose marriage he would also solemnize in violation of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004 (Notarial Rules).[16]
As extensively discussed in this Court's ruling, the repeated disregard and unjustified noncompliance with the well-established rules, i.e., A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, A.M. No. 08-7-429-RTC, A.O. No. 12-2010, and the Notarial Rules, constitute gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct. While these are serious charges that warrant the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service, this Court deemed it proper to impose upon Judge Justalero the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one year, taking into consideration the fact that he had not been previously found liable for an administrative offense and that he had a heavy caseload.[17]
 
The case of Flores-Concepcion v. Castañeda[18] explains that there is no and fast rule in determining the imposable penalty, as this often lies within this Court's discretion pursuant to Article VIII, Section 11 of the Constitution, with due consideration to the gravity of the offense and the penalties previously imposed in similar cases. Nevertheless, the purpose of administrative penalties should be to restore and preserve the public trust in the judiciary. Specific to the penalty of suspension, it is a negative reinforcement that is meant to make the respondent suffer for tarnishing the court's reputation.[19]","This Court resolves the Letters dated July 27, 2023,[1] August 15, 2023,[2] and September 13, 2023[3] (collectively, Letters) submitted by Judge Globert J. Justalero (Judge Justalero), seeking to clarify this Court's January 18, 2023 Decision[4] that meted him the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one year, with stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely.[5]

Foremost, we shall treat the Letters of Judge Justalero as his Motion for Partial Reconsideration of this Court's Decision. In his Letters, he prayed that this Court should: (1) consider the period within which he was placed under preventive suspension for purposes of counting the service of his one-year suspension; and (2) award him back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits under equity considerations, citing this Court's Resolution in Re: Payment of Backwages and Other Economic Benefits of Judge Philbert I. Iturralde, RTC Branch 58, Angeles City (Iturralde)[6] and this Court's Decision in Office of the Court of Administrator v. Floro, Jr. (Floro).[7] He averred that he had no source of income during his preventive suspension, other than his teaching job, and had incurred several debts to undergo surgery.[8] ","Meanwhile, our ruling in Floro demonstrates that back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits may be warranted when the imposition of the penalty, i.e., separation from the service, is ""not a penalty as [W]e ordinarily understand the word to mean. It [was] imposed instead out of necessity upon [Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr. (Judge Floro)] due to a medically disabling condition of the mind which [rendered] him [unfit] to continue discharging the functions of his office.""[50] Thus, even if Judge Floro was found responsible for the delay in the resolution of his case, we awarded him back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for a period corresponding to three years, considering the seven ""excruciating"" years of suspension during which he was unable to practice any profession.[51]

While the penalty imposed by this Court on Judge Floro was borne out of the medical condition that rendered him unfit in the service, the penalty of suspension meted to Judge Justalero serves as punishment for tarnishing the image of the courts, and is a negative reinforcement meant to restore and preserve the public trust in the judiciary.[52] Therefore, while Judges Floro and Justalero both underwent more than seven years of preventive suspension, the circumstances surrounding the two cases are very different for us to simply straightjacket the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits awarded under equity considerations.

Notwithstanding the completely different circumstances in Itturalde and Floro, there still exist equitable grounds for this Court to partially grant the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits that Judge Justalero could have earned during his preventive suspension. It bears stressing that the Decision found Judge Justalero's infractions to merit the penalty of suspension for a period of one year. In relation to such penalty, his continued suspension deprived him of his main source of income for a much longer time.

To reiterate, Judge Justalero was preventively suspended ""until further orders of [this] Court"" in the Resolution dated January 20, 2016.[53] Given that the OCA commenced its investigation on June 1, 2016 and that the delay in the disposition of the case was not attributable to him, Judge Justalero should have been reinstated no later than September 30, 2016 in accordance with Rule 140, Sections 5 and 10 of the Rules of Court, as amended.

On the other hand, since the judgment imposed upon Judge Justalero the penalty of one-year suspension from office without pay,[54] the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits corresponding to one year shall be deducted from the computation of those benefits that Judge Justalero could have earned from September 30, 2016. In other words, Judge Justalero would only be entitled to back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits from September 30, 2017 up to the time of his reinstatement.","ACCORDINGLY, the Letters dated July 27, 2023, August 15, 2023, and September 13, 2023 of Judge Globert J. Justalero, which are hereby jointly treated as his Motion for Reconsideration, are PARTIALLY GRANTED PRO HAC VICE. The penalty of one-year suspension imposed upon Judge Globert J.

"G.R. No. 260148, April 03, 2024","HERMINIO A. BESMONTE, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSION-NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NAPOLCOM-NCR), RESPONDENT.","The present controversy had at its inception the conduct of a buy-bust operation for the purpose of apprehending a person who was suspected of illegally peddling dangerous drugs. The dramatis personae are Besmonte, a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the suspect, Evangeline Abenojar (Abenojar).

Following a tip which was made by a confidential informant alleging that Abenojar was involved in the illegal drug trade, a buy-bust operation was conducted by Besmonte who, at that time, held the rank of Police Officer 2 (PO2), along with PO2 Gil Anos (PO2 Anos), and PO2 Junnifer Tuldanes (PO2 Tuldanes), at around 10:30 p.m. of April 11, 2003.

Based on the uniform narration[10] of Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes, upon arriving at the target site which was situated at Factor Compound, Almanza Uno, Las Piñas City, Abenojar called Besmonte's attention and asked the latter, ""Kukuha ba kayo?""[11] Besmonte, being the designated poseur-buyer, approached Abenojar and signified his intention to buy PHP 100.00 worth of shabu, a dangerous drug. Then, Abenojar left for a while. When she returned with a plastic sheet containing suspected shabu, she demanded payment from Besmonte. The buy-bust transaction was consummated when Besmonte gave Abenojar the marked money in exchange for the said plastic sheet containing suspected shabu. It was at this point that Besmonte held Abenojar's hand and introduced himself as a police officer. However, Abenojar resisted. PO2 Anos and PO2 Tuldanes as back-up members of the buy-bust team, assisted Besmonte by helping to restrain Abenojar. However, Abenojar was still trying to resist them by kicking and uttering vituperative words such as ""Putang ina nyo! Hindi naman kayo mga pulis! Mga adik kayo! Nagpapanggap Zang kayong mga pulis!""[12] Besmonte claimed that after exerting reasonable force, they successfully arrested Abenojar who was later charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165,[13] otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act of 2002, and violation of Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code (Resistance and Disobedience to a Person in Authority or the Agents of Such Person).[14]

Diametrically opposing the foregoing account, Abenojar asserted that the police officers tried to extort her and, failing to do so, physically harmed her.

Abenojar expounded that at around 9:30 p.m. of April 11, 2003, while she was on her way to the house of a certain Auring, she came across the three police officers who were wearing civilian clothes. One of the police officers shouted ""Hoy!!! Hoy!!!""[15] and asked about her name, residential address and what was inside her pocket. Abenojar pulled the amount of PHP 700.00 from her pocket but did not give the same to the police officers. This resulted in PO2 Tuldanes and PO2 Anos holding her arms while Besmonte cursed at her, blurting out ""Putang ina mo! Akina yang pera!""[16] When Abenojar still refused to give the money, Besmonte punch the left side of her face and kicked her knee. This caused Abenojar to feel intense pain and dizziness. Then, Abenojar was brought to a vacant lot where Besmonte declared, ""Tuluyan na natin yan dito.""[17] Abenojar then broke free and kicked Besmonte's thigh. However, Besmonte managed to kick her abdomen. The police officers then brought Abenojar to the Drug Enforcement Unit, Las Piñas City Police Station where she was incarcerated.[18]

In view of the foregoing, Abenojar filed a handwritten letter-­complaint[19] against Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes before the NAPOLCOM. To corroborate her claim of physical abuse at the hands of the members of the buy-bust team, Abenojar presented a Medical Certificate[20] which was issued on April 14, 2003 by Dr. Ferdinand C. Eusebio (Dr. Eusebio) of the Las Piñas City Health Office. Dr. Eusebio found that Abenojar sustained ""Left Zygomatic area (+) Swelling (+) Tenderness. Right Inguinal Area (+) Tenderness (-) Hematoma.""[21] In layman's terms, Dr. Eusebio reported that Abenojar's left cheek and groin area were swollen and tender.[22]

Thereafter, the Regional Investigation Unit of the NAPOLCOM, National Capital Region, as nominal complainant, formally charged Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes with Grave Misconduct as follows:
That on April 11, 2003 at around 9:30 in the evening at Las Piñas City and within the administrative jurisdiction of this Honorable Commission, PO2 Gil Anos, PO2 Herminio Besmonte and PO2 Junnifer Tuldanes taking advantage of their position as police officers, conspiring, confederating and helping one another did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously without legal ground arrest, search and detain complaining witness Evangeline Abenojar. Even without resistance from complaining witness respondent PO2 Tuldanes holds [sic] her right arm while PO2 Anos was holding her left arm, therafter without any aggression from the same complaining witness PO2 Besmonte hit her left face and threatens [sic] her by uttering scary words to wit: ""TULUYAN NA NATIN YAN DITO"", thereby inflicting upon her physical injuries and emotional sufferings [sic] and depriving her of liberty and freedom, to the damage and prejudice of complaining witness Evangeline Abenojar.

SP No. 161581.

The challenged issuances dismissed the Rule 43[4] Petition for Review[5] interposed by petitioner Herminio A. Besmonte (Besmonte) which, in turn, disputed the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) Decision No. 180629[6] dated November 22, 2018 and Resolution No. 1900696[7] dated June 18, 2019.

I.

A cursory review of the nature and manner of commission of the administrative offense of Grave Misconduct is imperative.
 
Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer.[43] It is the intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior.[44]

In administrative cases, misconduct can be classified as either simple or grave. Simple misconduct has been defined as an unacceptable behavior which transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers, work-related or not.[45] On the other hand, in grave misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule must be manifest.[46]

Corruption as an element of grave misconduct consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his or her station or character to procure some benefit for himself/herself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others.[47] Clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of an established rule presupposes that there is an order or regulation defied by the public official.[48] In Imperial, Jr. v. Government Service Insurance System:[49]
Flagrant disregard of rules is a ground that jurisprudence has already touched upon. It has been demonstrated, among others, in the instances when there had been open defiance of a customary rule; in the repeated voluntary disregard of established rules in the procurement of supplies; in the practice of illegally collecting fees more than what is prescribed for delayed registration of marriages; when several violations or disregard of regulations governing the collection of government funds were committed; and when the employee arrogated unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties. The common denominator in these cases was the employee's propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by his or her actions.[50]
Without any of these elements, the transgression of an established rule is properly characterized as simple misconduct only.[51]
","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated October 29, 2021 and the Resolution dated March 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 161581 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioner Herminio A. Besmonte is found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and is ORDERED suspended from office for a period of six (6) months."
"G.R. No. 250613, April 03, 2024","ELENITA V. MACALINAO, KENNETH V. MACALINAO AND KRISTEL V. MACALINAO, PETITIONERS, VS. CERINA, A.K.A. CERENA N. MACALINAO AND CINDY N. MACALINAO, RESPONDENTS.
","The facts which gave rise to the present controversy involve two marriages and two families who share a husband and father, whose death brought about the question of who may claim the proceeds of his death benefits.

For one, owing to the relevant law's guidance as to how the proceeds of the death benefits in question may be distributed to the beneficiaries, this issue is theoretically knotted as it invites the Court to make the journey into the territory of a longstanding doctrinal debate over a matter that the New Civil Code[6] is decidedly silent on—the share of a surviving spouse in the event that said spouse concurs with one legitimate child, or with legitimate children in the context of an intestate succession. For another, the foregoing debate, once settled by the Court, inevitably bleeds into the reality of the lives of the subject surviving families, in a manner that reveals what perhaps may be a discerned gap in the law.

Faced with the uncommon question of who between the long estranged legal spouse and the subsequent spouse by a bigamous marriage may claim rights to the compensation and benefits for a seafarer's death, the Court finds, pursuant to the relevant POEA rules and their cross-reference to the rules on succession, that only the surviving legitimate spouse may receive the proceeds of the death benefits alongside the deceased spouse's children from both marriages.

A straightforward recollection of the relevant facts which inform the Court's disposition is called for.

Pedrito G. Macalinao (Pedrito) and herein respondent Cerena Negapatan Macalinao (Cerena) married on June 5, 1981, and they were blessed with one child, herein respondent Cindy Macalinao (Cindy). However, only four years after they were married, Pedrito and Cerena separated in fact.[7]

On April 3, 1990, with his marriage to Cerena subsisting, Pedrito entered into a marriage with Elenita, after which they lived together as husband and wife for 25 years, until Pedrito's death on June 26, 2015.[8]

Before his death, Pedrito worked as a seafarer employed by Excel Marine Co. Ltd./Fair Shipping Corporation (Excel Marine). Since he died onboard the vessel of Excel Marine and was a member of the Association of Marine Officers and Seafarers Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP), his death benefits were determined to be in the amount of USD 93,057.88 or PHP 4,506,309.52.[9]
 
In August 2016, Cerena and Cindy (collectively, respondents) filed a petition for the declaration of nullity of the marriage of Pedrito and Elenita. The RTC, however, noted that it was not in accord with A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC Re: Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages. The following month, the RTC held a clarificatory hearing where it was established that respondents' true intention in filing the petition was to undertake a settlement of the estate of Pedrito.[10] Based on the said clarification, the RTC ordered the petition to be amended, and respondents subsequently filed an Amended Petition for the Settlement of Estate of the deceased Pedrito, with the issue of the declaration of nullity of the marriage of Pedrito and Elenita considered a secondary issue therein.[11] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) entered its appearance.[12]

In its Order dated March 27, 2017, the RTC dropped Excel Marine as respondent on the condition that it would issue, as it did, a manager's check in the name of the Heirs of Pedrito Macalinao with the face value equivalent to the computed benefits of Pedrito.[13] Excel Marine later deposited the amount of PHP 4,506,309.52 to the Land Bank of the Philippines (later to the Office of the Clerk of Court of RTC, Muntinlupa City) as the full and complete settlement of its obligation in the instant case.[14]

During the pre-trial, the following facts, among others, were agreed upon by the parties as undisputed:
(i)
Pedrito married Cerena on June 5, 1981;


(ii)
Pedrito and Cerena had one child, Cindy;


(iii)
On April 3, 1990, Pedrito married Elenita;


(iv)
Pedrito and Elenita had two children, Kenneth and Kristel;


(v)
At the time of the second marriage between Pedrito and Elenita, the marriage between Pedrito and Cerena was still existing;


(vi)
There was no filing of any petition for declaration of nullity of the marriage between Pedrito and Cerena; they were only separated in fact for over 24 years prior to Pedrito's death;


(vii)
Cerena, for her part, contracted a second marriage with one Rene Paredes (Rene) on February 7, 1992;


(viii)
Elenita received the cadaver of Pedrito when it was repatriated to the Philippines from Japan;


(ix)
Elenita also received the allotment as spouse of Pedrito based on the latter's employment contract;


(x)
The only property left by Pedrito upon his death are the subject death benefits.[15]
Due to the parties' failure to amicably settle, the RTC determined that the sole issue for its disposition was whether the subject death benefits form part of the estate of Pedrito and, in case they do, the manner by which the total amount may be divided among the claiming parties.[16]
","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] dated August 29, 2019 and Resolution[3] dated November 25, 2019 of the First Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112739.

The assailed Decision denied the appeal of herein petitioners Elenita V. Macalinao (Elenita), Kenneth V. Macalinao (Kenneth), and Kristel V. Macalinao (Kristel) (collectively, petitioners), and affirmed the September 12, 2018 Decision[4] of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa City (RTC). Similarly, the assailed Resolution denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration[5] and affirmed the assailed Decision.
","The Petition is partly meritorious, albeit for reasons different from those it brought forth.

The assailed Decision and Resolution are affirmed with the crucial modifications on the matter of how the death benefits by reason of Pedrito's death should be treated, and how they must be distributed to the beneficiaries as contemplated by both the POEA Memorandum Circular vis-à-vis the New Civil Code rules on succession.

To finally put an end to the instant controversy, the Court must first, necessarily, reframe the initial lens from which the principal issue is construed, and definitively answer the two questions on which the disposition pivots: 
(i)
Do the proceeds of the death benefits form part of Pedrito's estate?


(ii)
How and among whom should the proceeds of the death benefits be distributed?
The Court now resolves that: (i) the proceeds of the death benefits are directly payable to the beneficiaries not as a form of inheritance, but as proceeds from a death benefit; (ii) the only qualified beneficiaries to claim the same are Cerena as the legitimate surviving spouse, Cindy as Pedrito's legitimate child from the first marriage, and Kenneth and Kristel, as Pedrito's illegitimate children from the bigamous marriage, and the death benefits shall be distributed among them in accordance with Articles 999 and 983 of the New Civil Code in relation to its Articles 892 and 895, as modified by Article 176 of the Family Code.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated August 29, 2019, and Resolution dated November 25, 2019 of the First Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 260944, April 03, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FERNAN CALINES Y MAGASTINO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Calines was charged with frustrated homicide and murder in two separate Informations,[4] the accusatory portions of each read:

CRIMINAL CASE NO. 16-CR-11674
(frustrated homicide)

That on the 19th day of December, 2016, at Sitio Pasanan, Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and assault NIDA CALASIAO SABADO by striking her several times with a piece of wood, thus performing all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of Homicide as a consequence but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the accused, that is, by the act of the offended party in running away and the timely and able medical assistance rendered to her which prevented her death, to her damage and prejudice.[5]

CRIMINAL CASE NO. 17-CR-11741
(murder)

That on or about the 19th day of December, 2016, at Sitio Pasanan, Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and without any sufficient provocation or reason whatsoever, by means of treachery and use of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously strike several times with a piece of wood, SKY SABADO y CALASIAO, a minor being three (3) years and eight (8) months of age at the time of incident, thereby inflicting fatal wounds on the different parts of the body of SKY SABADO y CALASIAO which caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.

That in the commission of the crime, the qualifying aggravating circumstances of treachery and use of superior strength as the accused, a fully grown adult, attacked SKY SABADO y CALASIAO, a child of tender years and therefore incapable of defending himself against the attacks committed by the accused who consciously adopted and employed a method or means of attack which directly insured its execution without risk to himself.[6]

During the scheduled arraignment on March 13, 2017, the defense counsel manifested that Calines intended to plead guilty to both charges but requested for the cancellation thereof to give him time to explain the consequences of his plea.[7]","Before the Court is an ordinary Appeal[1] seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated June 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13812, which affirmed with modification the Consolidated Judgment[3] dated November 15, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of La Trinidad, Benguet, Branch 63 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 16-CR-11674 and 17-CR-11741, finding accused-appellant Fernan Calines y Magastino (Calines) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted homicide and murder, respectively.","The Appeal has no merit.

Calines conviction for murder and attempted homicide must be upheld
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) states:

Article 248. Murder. – Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:

1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.

Jurisprudence dictates that the elements of murder are: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.[36]

Meanwhile, Article 6 of the RPC states that there is an attempt to commit a felony when the offender directly commences its commission by overt acts but was unable to perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his or her own spontaneous desistance.

In turn, the Court held that attempted homicide is committed when the accused intended to kill the victim, as manifested by the use of a deadly weapon in the assault, and the wound/s sustained by the victim was/were not fatal.[37]

In this case, all the elements of murder and attempted homicide are present as will be discussed below.

It bears to recall that Sky was only three years old when he was killed by Calines. Moreover, the corresponding Information filed against him alleged the qualifying circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength. Jurisprudence teaches that the killing of a child of tender years is deemed ipso facto qualified by treachery due to his or her inherent defenselessness.[38] Therefore, the CA correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery in the killing of Sky, especially considering that he had no way of defending himself. The CA also correctly ruled that abuse of superior strength is already absorbed in treachery. Thus, Calines was properly adjudged to have committed the crime of murder.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated June 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13812 is hereby AFFIRMED, as follows:

(1)
In Criminal Case No. 17-CR-11741, Fernan Calines y Magastino is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of murder and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.

(2)
In Criminal Case No. 16-CR-11674, Fernan Calines y Magastino is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of attempted homicide and is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to four years and two months of prision correccional, as maximum.

All monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid."
"G.R. No. 265610, April 03, 2024","WALTER L. BORROMEO AND JIMMY N. PARCIA, PETITIONERS, VS. LAZADA E-SERVICES PHILIPPINES, INC., ALEX DORONOLLO, ALLAN ANCHETA, RICHARD DELANTAR, AND SAM REYES, RESPONDENTS.","On April 1, 2016[6] and July 16, 2017,[7] Borromeo and Parcia, respectively, signed an Independent Contractor Agreement (Agreement) with Lazada, where they agreed to provide logistics and delivery services for the company using their own motor vehicles. Their respective contracts provided that they would be paid a service fee in the amount of PHP 1,200.00 for a full day's work. Borromeo's contract was good for one year, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Clause 6 of the Agreement or renewed in writing, while the engagement of Parcia was for a duration of six months, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Clause 7 or renewed in writing at the sole discretion of Lazada.[8]

As riders, Borromeo and Parcia were tasked to pick-up products sold through the Lazada platform from its merchants and deliver them to Lazada's warehouse. According to them, Reyes, the route dispatcher team leader, would provide them a route sheet which contained their assigned merchants from whom they will pick-up the products for transfer to the warehouse. Borromeo and Parcia had to report to the monitoring supervisor and route monitoring staff of Lazada the moment they arrive at the location of their assigned merchants to be able to scan the products. They also had to inform them, through text messages or phone calls, the number of products they picked-up from the said merchants. Aside from the route sheet, Borromeo and Parcia were also directed to retrieve defective items from the return department for return to the merchants, which was no longer part of their job as riders but which they could not refuse for fear that they would not be given new routes for pick-up.[9]

On August 18 and 19, 2017, Borromeo and Parcia were informed that they would be terminated on August 23, 2017 because Lazada was reducing personnel at its pick-up department, and that it would be retaining only five pick-up riders. This prompted Borromeo and Parcia to file before the NLRC a complaint for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of overtime pay, holiday pay, holiday premium pay, rest day premium pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay, illegal deductions on their respective surety bonds, regularization, as well as for payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[10]

Borromeo and Parcia claimed that they were regular employees of Lazada not only because their work were directly related and usually desirable to the business of Lazada which was the selling of products online, but also due to the fact that RGServe and Dynamic were labor-only contractors. They assert that their dismissal was illegal as it was made without legal basis since they did not commit any misconduct against Lazada. Procedural due process was likewise not observed before their services were terminated.[11]

Lazada moved for the dismissal of the complaint and countered that Borromeo and Parcia were independent contractors and not its employees for the following reasons: (a) they make use of their own vehicles in providing the contracted services; (b) they were duly registered and licensed to perform delivery and transportation services with the pertinent business permits, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) registrations; and (c) their individual contracts explicitly provided that there will be no employer-employee relationship between the parties.[12]

Lazada further claimed that its contract with Borromeo expired on March 30, 2017 and the same was not renewed because Borromeo did not agree to do last mile delivery services. On the other hand, its contract with Parcia was still in effect when he was informed that there was going to be a change from first mile pick up to last mile delivery. Since Parcia no longer went back to work after asking for time to consider the proposed change in his service route, Lazada decided to terminate the contract. It served a Notice of Pre-Termination[13] dated September 5, 2017, but Parcia refused to accept it. Lazada argued that Borromeo and Parcia were not illegally dismissed because they were never its employees. Thus, the case did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter, and Borromeo and Parcia were not entitled to their monetary claims which were reserved only for regular employees. There was also no basis to implead Doronollo, Ancheta, Delantar, and Reyes.[14]

In a Decision,[15] the Labor Arbiter dismissed Borromeo and Parcia's complaint for lack of jurisdiction after finding that there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties. The Labor Arbiter held that the Agreement between the parties, the BIR Authority for Borromeo and Parcia to print official receipts, BIR Certificate of Registration, and DTI Certificate of Business Name Registration in their names sufficiently proved that Borromeo and Parcia were not employees of Lazada, but that they were separately engaged as independent contractors to undertake delivery and transportation business using motor vehicles registered in their names at the rate of PHP 1,200.00 for a full day of actual service, inclusive of fuel costs, telephone contacts with customers and other expenses, payable every 15th and 30th day of the month. The fact that Borromeo and Parcia issued BIR official receipts for the service fees they received and that Lazada did not deduct the mandatory Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and Pag-Ibig contributions from their fees all the more showed that they were not its employees. The parties' desire not to be bound by the employer-employee relationship was expressly stipulated in the Agreements they signed.[16]

The Labor Arbiter continued that the control test in determining the existence of employer-employee relationship between the parties was not also satisfied in that it was not sufficiently shown that Lazada controlled the means and methods by which they individually fulfilled their obligations as Lazada's only concern was that they get the deliveries done. Lazada's act of providing them with route sheets did not negate the existence of independent contractor agreement since the route sheets only apprised them where to pick-up the parcels for delivery to Lazada's warehouse, and eventually for dispatch to the buyers, and it was not a means to dictate upon them the method to be employed to attain the desired result. Thus, instead of being illegally dismissed, the Labor Arbiter found that the Agreement between Lazada and Parcia was pre-terminated on September 5, 2017 under Clause 7 thereof, while Lazada's contract with Borromeo ended on March 30, 2017. The Labor Arbiter concluded that since no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties, their contracts were governed by the Civil Code and the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction over the complaint.[17]

The Labor Arbiter also noted that Borromeo and Parcia did not implead as indispensable parties RGServe and Dynamic, the manpower agencies that initially hired them as delivery riders for Lazada. As such, their unsubstantiated allegation that RGServe and Dynamic were mere labor-only contractors which made them regular employees of Lazada could not be passed upon.[18] The Labor Arbiter disposed of the case in this wise:","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which found that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter dismissing the complaint filed by Walter L. Borromeo (Borromeo) and Jimmy Parcia (Parcia) against Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc. (Lazada), Alex Doronollo[4] (Doronollo), Allan Ancheta (Ancheta), Richard Delantar (Delantar), and Sam Reyes (Reyes) (collectively, Lazada et al.) for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that there is no employer-employee relationship between the parties.
Borromeo started to render service as a pick-up rider for Lazada on February 5, 2015 until March 31, 2016 under RGServe Manpower Services (RGServe). On the other hand, Parcia commenced his services as Lazada's pick-up rider from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2016 under Dynamic Personnel Assistance Manpower (Dynamic).[5","A party desiring to appeal an adverse judgment, final order, or resolution rendered by the CA, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Regional Trial Courts or other courts, when allowed by law, in cases other than criminal cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment,[43] may file a petition for review on certiorari before this Court.[44] However, before this Court takes cognizance of such petition, the basic procedural standards set forth under Rule 45 must first be satisfied.[45] These are as follows:

(1)
that the petition does not only exclusively raise questions of law, but also that it distinctly sets forth those legal issues;
(2)
that it be filed within 15 days of notice of the adverse ruling that impels it;
(3)
that docket and other lawful fees are paid;
(4)
that proper service is made;
(5)
that all matters that Section 4 specifies are indicated, stated, or otherwise contained in it;
(6)
that it is manifestly meritorious;
(7)
that it is not prosecuted manifestly for delay; and
(8)
that the questions raised in it are of such substance as to warrant consideration.[46] (Citations omitted)
Inasmuch as petitioners were not able to file their petition within the 15-day reglementary period, one of the requisites mentioned above, this Court is at liberty to deny outright or deny due course to the Rule 45 Petition they filed.[47] The dismissal of a belatedly-filed petition also finds support under Section S(a), Rule 56 of the Rules of Court. The Section reads:

Section 5. Grounds for dismissal of appeal. – The appeal may be dismissed motu proprio or on motion of the respondent on the following grounds:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On January 21, 2015, Nanzan, along with four other individuals,[5] were charged with the crime of estafa,[6] defined and penalized under paragraph 2(a), Article 315 of the RPC, under the following Information,[7] docketed as Crim. Case No. 15-534:
On 27th day of June 2013, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the [C]ity of Makati, the Philippines, [the] accused, conspiring and confederating together, with intent to defraud and by means of false pretenses, misrepresentations and fraudulent acts made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of fraud, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud complainant, Oaña Credit Solutions, Inc. [(Oaña Credit)], herein represented by Rommelito S. Tolentino, in the following manner: accused, in order to convince [Oaña Credit] to grant them a bridge financing loan represented to [Oaña Credit] that they will cause the release to [Oaña Credit] or its representative the proceeds of the pre-approved loan with PS Bank Zapote Branch, but such representations were false, the truth being that accused never had [the] intention to release the proceeds of the PSBank loan to Oaña [Credit], but rather keep the proceeds to themselves and profit therefrom, which representations were solely made to convince [Oaña Credit] to approve the bridge loan, and release to accused the amount of [PHP] 2,565,325[.00], but accused do not intend to pay or honor the same, as in fact said amount was not paid to [Oaña Credit], nor the proceeds of the PSBank loan released to [Oaña Credit], to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the aforesaid amount of [PHP] 2,565,325[.00].","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] inveighs against the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which found petitioner Maycel Balucero Nanzan (Nanzan) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of other deceits, as defined and penalized under the first paragraph of Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), and which denied her Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. CR No. 43447.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court reiterates that only questions of law may be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, and an examination of questions of facts is allowed only in exceptional circumstances.[51] ""The determination of whether the elements of the crimes charged exist pertains to question of facts as this requires the recalibration of the whole evidence presented.""[52] Petitioner seeks to overturn the findings of the lower courts on the ground that ""facts of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied,"" specifically that the CA sustained her conviction by ""conveniently ignoring and glossing over the existence of the [real estate mortgage] in this whole matter ""[53]

Indeed, Nanzan bemoans the purported failure of the courts a quo to duly consider the existence of the real estate mortgage executed between the parties, which, if taken into account, would have supposedly negated her criminal liability.[54] She insists that the presentation of the real estate mortgage itself was unnecessary since the contents thereof are not in issue; hence, substitutionary evidence may suffice to prove its existence. In this case, petitioner argues that the loan agreement itself proves the existence of the real estate mortgage since it makes specific reference thereto in its provisions.[55]

Nanzan's thesis cannot pass judicial muster.

It is an inviolable principle that the ""[t]he court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.""[56] Nanzan continuously harps on the real estate mortgage as the legal mooring of her innocence, however, the lower courts could not appreciate the same for the simple reason that such instrument was never even offered as evidence. As the RTC correctly adjudged, ""it is technically and legally speaking not on record.""[57]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. SEN. ANTONIO F. TRILLANES IV, RESPONDENT.
","Former Senator Antonio F. Trillanes IV (Trillanes) is a former active member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), particularly the Philippine Navy, with the rank of Lieutenant Senior Grade.[1]

On July 27, 2003, Trillanes led a group of armed soldiers known as the Magdalo Group and took over the Oakwood Premier Apartments in Makati City. This event has been since known as the Oakwood Mutiny. Because of his acts, Trillanes, along with the other members of the Magdalo Group involved in the Oakwood Mutiny, were charged with the crime of Coup d’etat under Article 134-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The case was filed before Branch 148 (Branch 148), Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, and docketed as Criminal Case No. 03-2784, titled People of the Philippines v. Antonio F. Trillanes, IV, et al. (the Coup d’etat Case).[2]

During the pendency of the Coup d’etat Case, Trillanes won a Senate seat in the 2007 elections.

On November 29, 2007, during a hearing in the Coup d’etat Case before Branch 148, Trillanes and the other members of the Magdalo Group walked out of the court and proceeded to take over the Manila Peninsula Hotel. Trillanes and the Magdalo Group called for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. This event is now known as the Manila Peninsula Incident.[3]

Police authorities attempted to serve a warrant of arrest for direct contempt issued by Branch 148, but Trillanes and his group refused to receive it. Thus, the police were eventually forced to break into the hotel to arrest Trillanes and his group.[4]

Because of the Manila Peninsula Incident, Trillanes, among others, was subsequently charged with Rebellion in 2007. The case was filed before Branch 150 (Branch 150), RTC Makati City, and docketed as Criminal Case No. 07-3126, titled People of the Philippines v. Sen. Antonio F. Trillanes IV, et al.[5] (the Rebellion Case).[6]

On November 24, 2010, former President Benigno S. Aquino, III (President Aquino) issued Proclamation No. 75, Series of 2010 (Proclamation No. 75).[7] Proclamation No. 75 granted amnesty to all active and former personnel of the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP), and their supporters, who have or may have committed crimes punishable under the RPC, the Articles of War, or other laws, in connection with the Oakwood Mutiny, the Marines Stand-Off, and the Manila Peninsula Incident.[8]","These consolidated cases require the Court to determine the limits of presidential power weighed against the protections granted under the Bill of Rights. In resolving this issue, the Court, as it is sworn to do, anchors its ruling on the Constitution and the supremacy of the rule of law.
The Court affirms the value of procedural rules in enforcing and protecting the fundamental right to due process and the equal protection of the laws. Indeed, the duty of governing a country requires the exercise of great powers. In the government's zeal to perform its duty, there can be a risk to take certain laws and rules lightly upon the belief that these are minor irregularities justified by the importance of the task at hand. Nonetheless, no intention, no matter how lofty, warrants a violation of fundamental freedoms and of cornerstone public policies that help keep our system of justice alive.

In these consolidated cases, the Court upholds the Constitution and reaffirms that no one, not even the President, is above the law.","G.R. No. 241494

The Court first resolves the procedural issues.

Procedural Issues

Trillanes did not commit forum shopping
The meaning of forum shopping is well established. In Top Rate Development Construction & General Services, Inc. v. Paxton Corporation,[110] the Court explained:

FORUM SHOPPING is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits indifferent courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action.[111]

Further, in City of Taguig v. City of Makati,[112] the Court ruled:

Ultimately, what is truly important to consider in determining whether forum-shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigant by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issue.[113] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted)

The test to ascertain if forum shopping exists is whether in two or more cases, there is identity of parties, rights, causes of action, and reliefs sought.[114] With respect specifically to litis pendentia, it exists when the following elements concur: (a) identity of the parties in the two actions; (b) substantial identity in the causes of action and in the reliefs sought by the parties; and (c) the identity between the two actions should be such that any judgment that may be rendered in one case, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other.[115]

Here, Trillanes impleaded the respondents, in their official capacities, and sought to have Proclamation No. 572 declared invalid and unconstitutional. On the other hand, the matters then pending in Branch 148 and Branch 150 pertained to the Omnibus Motions filed by the People, through the DOJ, to issue warrants of arrest and HDOs against Trillanes. In his comments on these motions, Trillanes asked for the denial of the Omnibus Motions. He assailed the legal and factual bases of the Omnibus Motions and prayed that the trial courts deny the issuance of warrants of arrest and HDO i.e., that he has been granted amnesty and that the dismissals of the Rebellion and Coup d’etat Cases have become final and immutable. He did not raise in his comments the issue of the unconstitutionality of Proclamation No. 572. Trillanes filed the Certiorari Petition for the specific purpose of having Proclamation No. 572 declared unconstitutional and to bar Branch 150 and Branch 148 from hearing and granting the Omnibus Motions.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Injunction, dated September 5, 2018 filed by petitioner Antonio F. Trillanes IV in G.R. No. 241494 is GRANTED. Proclamation No. 572 is declared VOID.

Further, the Petition for Review with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Set the Case for Oral Argument, dated June 15, 2021 filed by the People in G.R. No. 256660 is DENIED.

Finally, the Petition for Review with prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Motion to Set the Case for Oral Argument, dated March 24, 2021, in G.R. No. 256078 is DENIED."
"A.C. No. 13995, April 03, 2024","JHYCKE G. PALMA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LADIMIR IAN G. MADURAMENTE, RESPONDENT.","Palma claims to be the duly elected President of The Great Warrior, a homeowner's association purportedly registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board. Allegedly, The Great Warrior engaged the legal services of Maduramente for several cases.[3]

One of the cases was Civil Case No. 6502-3, filed before Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities of General Santos City (MTCC), which involved an action for Injunction against Palma and all other persons claiming rights under her (Palma's group).[4] Plaintiffs in that case prayed for Palma's group to vacate the land they were occupying and pay for the damages they caused.[5]

Notably, Palma stated that plaintiffs therein moved to declare them in default because Maduramente failed to file their Answer on time. Fortunately, the MTCC eventually accepted their belatedly filed Answer and issued the order for the pre-trial conference. However, Maduramente failed to appear during the pre-trial conference and did not even file a pre-trial brief. Thus, the MTCC declared Palma's group in default.[6] Only plaintiffs therein were allowed to present evidence, which ultimately led to the resolution of the case in their favor.[7]

Verily, Maduramente allegedly promised to remedy the situation by filing a motion for reconsideration, which was nonetheless denied. He then filed a notice of appeal but this was not given due course by the MTCC on the ground that it was filed out of time. Palma added that they repeatedly asked Maduramente to withdraw from the case but he took so long to do so. It was only after they made incessant requests did Maduramente eventually withdraw and surrender the records of the case to Palma.[8]

Palma also narrated that Maduramente represented her group, in another case, an action for the Declaration of Nullity of Sale, Cancellation of Certificate of Title, and Damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 8506 before Branch 23, Regional Trial Court of General Santos City (RTC).[9] Palma's group intervened in that case on the ground that they have a better right over the property in dispute.[10] However, Palma claimed that Maduramente also represented the plaintiffs, in violation of the rule against conflict of interest.[11]

For Maduramente's part, he stated that he failed to attend the pre-trial conference for Civil Case No. 6502-3 because he was in Manila at the time. As proof, he attached an itinerary ticket. He claimed that it was Palma who did not attend said conference despite being advised to do so.[12] As to the belated filing of the notice of appeal, he stated that this was due to the inadvertence of his staff.[13]

Anent Civil Case No. 8506, Maduramente argued that there was no conflict of interest. He admitted that he was indeed the counsel on record of plaintiffs in that case. However, he only acted as counsel for Palma's group, as intervenors, because they were being harassed by the named landowners through requests for the disconnection of their electricity. Maduramente stated that the Complaint-in-Intervention was filed by Palma's group primarily to save on expenses.[14]
","Before the Court is an administrative Complaint[1] filed by Jhycke G. Palma (Palma) against respondent Ladimir Ian G. Maduramente (Maduramente). Palma imputes negligence to Maduramente and alleges that the latter violated the rule against conflict of interest. Accordingly, she prays that Maduramente be disbarred from the practice of law.[2]","The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP BOG.

It is settled that membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.[22] Only those who exhibit special fitness not only in intellect, but also in moral character, may continue to enjoy such privilege.[23] At all times, lawyers are expected to conduct themselves with great propriety, and their behavior must be beyond reproach.[24]

Verily, once a lawyer agrees to take up the cause of a client, they owe fidelity to such cause and must be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in them.[25] Any dereliction of duty by a lawyer affects the client.[26] Hence, they are expected to commit their entire devotion to the interest of the client, to the end that nothing be taken or withheld from his or her client, save by the rules of law, legally applied.[27]

Similarly, lawyers are duty-bound to avoid representing conflicting interests.[28] This is because the relationship between a lawyer and their client is imbued with the highest level of trust and confidence.[29] They are expected to turn down an offer for professional employment or the engagement of legal services, no matter how attractive the fees may be, if accepting the same would result to a violation of the prohibition against conflict of interest.[30]

The relevant provisions of the CPR in relation to a lawyer's responsibility in handling cases, and avoiding the representation of conflicting interests are as follows:
Canon 17 - A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him.

Canon 18 - A lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence.

Canon 15 - A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his clients.

Rule 15.03. - A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.
Nonetheless, the CPR has been repealed by A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC,[31] or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).[32] The CPRA includes a transitory provision, which states that it shall be applied to all pending and future cases, unless not feasible or would work injustice.[33] As the exceptions are not present in the instant case, the Court deems the application of the provisions of the CPRA to be proper.[34]

Concomitantly, the following provisions of the CPRA are pertinent to the instant case:","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Ladimir Ian G. Maduramente GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and the Lawyer's Oath. The Court imposes the following penalties against him:
1. SUSPENSION from the practice of law for a period of one year for gross negligence in the performance of his duty; and

2. SUSPENSION from the practice of law for a period of one year for an intentional violation of the conflict of interest rules.
However, considering that he has already been disbarred, these penalties can no longer be imposed but should nonetheless be considered if he should subsequently apply for the lifting of his disbarment. In view of his continuing disbarment, a penalty of a FINE in the amount of PHP 110,000.00 is imposed upon him for each offense.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Ladimir Ian Maduramente's personal records as attorney. Likewise, let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts in the country."
"G.R. No. 254465, April 03, 2024 ","JONATHAN DY CHUA BARTOLOME, PETITIONER, VS. TOYOTA QUEZON AVENUE, INC., LINCOLN T. LIM, ESTEBAN DELA PAZ, JR., JOSEFINA DE JESUS, AND PAULINE BACALING, RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in March 2009, petitioner Bartolome was hired by respondent Toyota Quezon Avenue, Inc. (TQAI) as a marketing professional trainee of its Vehicles Sales Department. In August 2010, he became a regular employee with the assigned task of selling Toyota brand cars, products, and services.[4]

On December 28, 2015, Bartolome received from the Human Resources Department of TQAI a Notice of Decision for Habitual Absences for the month of October 2015 and a Notice of Explanation for Habitual Absences for the month of November 2015. On top of these, he received another notice placing him under a seven-day suspension for a third offense.[5] To these notices, he submitted his reply.

On January 22, 2016, Bartolome and the management had a meeting where he got assisted by his sibling as counsel. After the meeting, he thought that the matter was already closed and settled. But in a subsequent marketing professionals' meeting, TQAI President Lim uttered the following unsavory remarks against him for bringing his lawyer-sibling to the meeting:[6]
""Kung hindi ba kayo nagaabsent gagawa ba kami ng paraan, kung sinusunod nyo nyo (sic) protocol natin gagawa ba kami ng paraan[?] Ayaw naman naming kayo higpitan kasi kailangan namin gawin. Bakit isa lang ba kayong empleyado sa opisinang ito, bakit only child ba kayo? Kung only child pwede kaso pag only child normally ano nangyayari pag only child ""spoiled"". Wag nyo naman kami subukan, tapos magdadala kayo ng tatay/nanay para isumbong kami, tapos icc: nyo kung sino man dapat nyo icc:""[7]
On January 25, 2016, TQAI referred the processing and sale of a car to Bartolome. By the time he finished processing the document, the client was already on board a vehicle which had a leather cover seat, albeit this accessory should not be included in the package. All he could do, however, was hand in the signed documents to the client.[8] Later on, he explained the incident to TQAI Group Retail Manager De Jesus and requested an investigation.[9] De Jesus responded ""[a]langan namang pati si Oda pagbayarin mo pa. Ano ba ang pinaglalaban mo?"" He was, therefore, left with the impression that he will be solely liable for the incident.[10]

On February 5, 2016, he voluntarily submitted documents explaining the incident and requesting an investigation. De Jesus simply collected the documents and did nothing more. Later, he found out that De Jesus paid for the leather seats cover, an action which could be taken against him (as if he admitted the incident and paid for it).[11]

After a few days, many of his accounts were unceremoniously withdrawn and transferred to another marketing professional without any explanation. On March 1, 2016, he was transferred to another team.[12] When he protested the sudden transfer of accounts, De Jesus told him, ""[a]yaw ka na pahawakan ng accounts ni Boss Lincoln. Accounts nya yan. Siya ang may say.""[13]

Still, he tried to process one particular sale under these accounts only to be stopped by TQAI General Sales Manager Dela Paz, who refused to sign the vehicle sales proposal. Dela Paz told him, ""[h]indi ka pwede magrelease sa kliyenteng ito. Pwede mo iprocess pero ipangalan mo sa iba."" He retorted, ""[e]h bakit ko po ipapangalan sa iba e, ako ang nagtrabaho?""[14] Dela Paz merely tapped another marketing professional to process the transaction. Dela Paz would subsequently refuse to sign off his sales proposal and pushed his unit allocation to the end of the line each time despite the ""first to submit/pay reservation"" policy.[15]

Meantime, his transfer to a new team did not go well either. His new boss Susan Sobreviñas asked him ""[a]no plano mo, magreresign ka?"" It then became clear to him that his transfer to another team was intended to force his resignation. On March 9, 2016, when he was asked by De Jesus to sign his 2015 Performance Scorecard, he raised certain concerns about it. A week after, he got back the scorecard which this time bore grades lower than when he first received it. He was nonetheless constrained to sign it under protest.[16]

Thereafter, he had another encounter with Dela Paz when the latter pressured him to sign a memorandum accepting changes in his performance bonus. That encounter was followed by his receipt of yet another Memorandum dated March 16, 2016, asking him to explain why he failed to meet his sales quota for the month of February 2016. On March 30, 2016, he replied that had he been allowed to release the units under his accounts, he would have met or exceeded his quota for February 2016.[17]

According to Bartolome, these series of events and the eventual hostile working environment which he endured every day made it impossible and unbearable for him to continue working for TQAI. Thus, he was forced to give up his position and tender his resignation letter on March 31, 2016, effective April 30, 2016. He also requested approval of his terminal leave beginning April 4, 2016. When he tried to process his clearance on April 21, 2016, he was treated like a stranger-criminal and was subjected to undue harassment. After almost three months of processing his clearance, he claimed that he received his last salary on July 9, 2016. It was less than what he ought to receive as salary; it also did not include his 13th month pay nor his earned commissions.[18]

On August 4, 2016, he filed a Complaint for illegal/constructive dismissal and money claims, titled Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome v. Toyota Quezon Avenue, Inc., Lincoln Lim, Franklin T. Lim, Esteban Dela Paz, Glecy Gamboa, Josefina De Jesus, and Pauline Bacaling, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 08-09774-16.[19]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155436:
1)
Decision[2] dated January 22, 2020, reversing the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioner Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome (Bartolome) was constructively dismissed by respondents Toyota Quezon Ave, Inc., Lincoln T. Lim (President Lim), Esteban Dela Paz, Jr. (Dela Paz), Josefina De Jesus (De Jesus), and Pauline Bacaling; and


2)
Resolution[3] dated November 19, 2020, denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.","As a rule, the Court, not being a trier of facts, will not take cognizance of factual issues, much less analyze or weigh evidence all over again. As an exception, however, it may proceed to probe and resolve factual issues where it appears that the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the NLRC and the labor arbiter, as in this case.[34]

Constructive dismissal arises ""when continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank and/or a diminution in pay; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee.""[35] In such cases, the impossibility, unreasonableness, or unlikelihood of continued employment leaves an employee with no other viable recourse but to terminate his or her employment.[36]

By definition, constructive dismissal can happen in any number of ways. At its core, however, is the gratuitous, unjustified, or unwarranted nature of the employer's action. As it is a question of whether an employer acted fairly, it is inexorable that any allegation of constructive dismissal be contrasted with the validity of exercising management prerogative.[37]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 22, 2020, and Resolution dated November 19, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155436 are REVERSED. Respondent Toyota Quezon Ave, Inc., Lincoln T. Lim, Esteban Dela Paz, Jr. and Josefina De Jesus are SOLIDARILY LIABLE for the illegal dismissal of petitioner Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome. They are ordered to PAY him the following:
1)
full Backwages computed from April 1, 2016 up to the finality of this Decision;


2)
separation pay equivalent to one month pay for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six months considered as one whole year, computed from March 2009 up to the finality of this Decision;


3)
commissions in the amount of PHP 83,341.80 plus adjustment of PHP 3,115.14 and PHP 6,230.28 representing two accounts excluded from his total commission; and


4)
moral and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 70,000.00.
Respondents are further ordered to PAY attorney's fees to petitioner equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award.
 
The total monetary award shall earn legal interest at 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.

"G.R. No. 257723, April 01, 2024","AURORA O. ARAGON-MABANG,* PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","On May 9, 2012, the Department of Budget and Management issued Special Allotment Release Order No. BMB-G-12-T-000002360 and Advice of NCA Issued (Fund 101) covering PHP 3,800,000.00 to the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) as the implementing agency for the livelihood project of Congressman Simeon A. Datumanong (Cong. Datumanong) of the 2nd District of Maguindanao in the Municipalities of Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sanki, and Mamasapano. The amount shall be sourced from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of Cong. Datumanong for the fiscal year of 2012.[6]

In a Letter[7] dated July 16, 2012, Cong. Datumanong requested Mehol K. Sadain (Sadain), then Secretary/Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF, to implement the Sustainable Livelihood Projects - Soapmaking, Candle Making, and Fish Processing (project), through the non-government organization (NGO) Maharlikang Lipi Foundation, Inc. (MLFI). He authorized Sadain to release the fund from his PDAF to MLFI.[8]

Accordingly, the NCMF initially released the amount of PHP 3,420,000.00 to MLFI on July 31, 2012 and retained ten percent of the allocated PDAF, which pertained to three percent (3%) or PHP 114,000.00 as monitoring expenses, and seven percent (7%) or PHP 266,000.00 as retention fee or final tranche. This was through an unnumbered and undated disbursement voucher[9] (1st DV) signed by Mabang, Fedelina D. Aldanese (Aldanese), and Sadain.

Mabang, as the Acting Chief of the Management Audit Division (MAD) under the Finance Management Services of the NCMF, certified that the expenses/advances were necessary, lawful, and incurred under her direct supervision. Aldanese, as the Acting Chief Accountant of the NCMF, certified that the supporting documents were complete, proper, and attached, as well as that the cash was available. Sadain approved the payment. Check No. 446187[10] dated July 31, 2012 was issued in favor of MLFI, who in turn, issued a receipt[11] dated August 8, 2012 to the NCMF.[12]

On August 10, 2012, the NCMF, represented by Sadain; the Office of Cong. Datumanong, represented by Cong. Datumanong; and MLFI, represented by its President, Gracita Cecilia Mascenon, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement[13] (MOA) in connection with the project pursuant to NCMF Resolution No. 48,[14] series of 2012 dated July 25, 2012.[15]

Subsequently, Mabang, NCMF Director III Galay M. Makalinggan (Makalinggan), Aldanese, and Sadain, signed an unnumbered DV[16] dated February 13, 2013 (2nd DV) in the same capacities as that of the 1st DV, except that Mabang and Makalinggan both certified that the expenses/advances were necessary, lawful, and incurred under their direct supervision. Queenie E. Rodriguez likewise signed the 2nd DV to certify that she received the payment from the NCMF. Check No. 84530[17] dated February 14, 2013, covering the retention fee of PHP 266,000.00 was issued to MLFI, who then issued a receipt[18] to the NCMF on the same day.[19]

The OMB-Field Investigation Office (FIO) filed a Complaint[20] dated June 30, 2015 for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service against Sadain, Makalinggan, Aldanese, Mabang, and NCMF Cashier Olga S. Galido (collectively, public respondents).[21]

The OMB-FIO alleged in its complaint that: (1) the NCMF violated Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 12-2007 dated June 29, 2007, in awarding the project to MLFI without conducting a public bidding or negotiated procurement; (2) the NCMF likewise violated Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 because it did not properly undertake the process in selecting the NGO as it was Cong. Datumanong who personally chose MLFI; (3) the NCMF released the fund to MLFI even before the execution of the MOA; and (4) public respondents conspired with one another when they processed the DVs, executed the MOA, and released the check payments to MLFI.[22]

Mabang denied conspiring with her co-public respondents. She stressed that: (1) she did not have any contact with Cong. Datumanong or anybody from his office; (2) she was not the principal signatory to the DVs and only signed them after all the supporting documents were attached; and (3) she merely performed her duties, which are procedural, mechanical, and non-discretionary, in good faith.[23]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Aurora O.

Nos. 257724 and 261349 is a minute resolution, it is considered a full disposition of the case and operates as res judicata with respect to the same issues and subject matter involving the same parties. However, it is not binding precedent as to the other parties who held different positions and discharged different functions.[47]

To recall, Sadain was the Secretary/Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF while Aldanese was the Acting Chief Accountant of the NCMF. In contrast, Mabang was the Acting Chief of the MAD. Evidently, they discharged different functions.

Verily, the Resolution dated June 15, 2022, of the First Division of the Court in G.R. Nos. 257724 and 261349 cannot prevent the Court from considering the merits of Mabang's petition.

Mabang is guilty of Simple Misconduct only.

When the CA affirms the factual findings of the OMB, the general rule is that the Court shall respect these findings and shall no longer disturb it. One of the recognized exceptions to this rule is when there is a misapprehension of facts.[48] This exception exists in the present case.

Misconduct is the ""transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross neglect of duty by a public officer."" To be considered grave, there must be corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules.[49]

Here, the CA affirmed the finding of the OMB that Mabang is liable for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service because she signed the DVs which enabled the release of the funds to MLFI, an NGO that was chosen by Cong. Datumanong without a public bidding or negotiated procurement.

The Court agrees in part.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.

Petitioner Aurora O. Aragon-Mabang is found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and is SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE for six (6) months without pay reckoned from the time the Decision dated December 16, 2016, of the Office of the Ombudsman was implemented, with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

The period within which petitioner Aurora O. Aragon-Mabang was dismissed from service pending appeal is creditable in the implementation of the penalty of six (6) months suspension herein imposed. All her rights, emoluments, benefits, and privileges removed by, and forfeited in, the assailed Decision of the Office of the Ombudsman are hereby RESTORED."
"G.R. Nos. 245330-31, April 01, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE AND COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., RESPONDENT.
","On January 29, 2003, however, the BIR issued BIR Ruling No. 001-2003,[9] which revoked the earlier issuance. Relying on the Certification dated December 20, 2002 of the Department of Energy (DOE), stating that aviation gas, fuel, and oil for use in domestic operation of domestic airline companies are locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, and price, the BIR declared that PAL's importations would no longer be tax-exempt ""for as long as there is such available domestic supply of petroleum products.""[10]

Thereafter, on various dates between April to June of 2005, PAL imported Jet A-1 fuel and paid the corresponding specific taxes due thereon under protest.[11]

PAL then lodged a request for refund with the CIR for the specific taxes it paid in the total amount of PHP 258,629,496.00. When its request remained unacted, PAL filed a judicial claim for refund before the CTA on May 7, 2007, through a Petition for Review.[12]

Both the CIR and the COC filed their respective Answers[13] to the Petition and raised similar special and affirmative defenses, to wit: (1) PAL failed to exhaust all administrative remedies; (2) BIR Ruling No. 001-2003 is a valid interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Code; (3) PAL failed to appeal BIR Ruling No. 001-2003 to the Secretary of Finance in accordance with the Tax Code; (4) in essence, PAL asked the CTA to overturn the factual determinations of the DOE in pursuing its refund claim, which cannot be allowed under the doctrine of separation of powers; and (5) the specific taxes purportedly paid in May and June of 2005 were not properly documented.[14]

The case then proceeded to trial.[15] After the formal offer of evidence and submission of memoranda by the parties, the case was deemed submitted for decision. However, PAL filed a Motion to Reopen Trial and/or Leave of Court to File Supplemental Memorandum,[16] which was granted by the CTA Second Division in its January 20, 2015 Resolution.[17] Thereafter, the case was again submitted for resolution.

In its original Decision,[18] the CTA Second Division partially granted the Petition and ordered the CIR and the COC to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of PAL in the reduced amount of PHP 88,542,854.00.[19] The CTA found that PAL was able to satisfy the conditions provided under Section 13 of Presidential Decree No. 1590, which would qualify its importations for tax exemption. Nevertheless, the CTA ratiocinated that it could not grant the full amount claimed by PAL given that certain official receipts evidencing payment of specific taxes were denied admission for PAL's failure to present the original receipts.[20]

Thereafter, the CIR and the COC filed their separate Motions for Partial Reconsideration,[21] whereas PAL filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Decision and/or to Reopen the Case for Presentation of Evidence on May 13, 2016.[22] In its Resolution,[23] the CTA Second Division resolved to grant respondent's Motion, while denying CIR and COC's similar bids for reconsideration.

PAL then presented an additional witness and other documentary exhibits in the subsequent hearings conducted by the CTA.[24]

In the meantime, the CIR filed a Petition for Review[25] before the CTA En Banc, docketed as CTA EB No. 1488. The COC likewise filed its own Petition,[26] which was docketed as CTA EB No. 1494. The two cases were then consolidated given that they arose from the same assailed rulings of the CTA Second Division in CTA Case No. 7632.[27]

Eventually, the CTA Second Division issued its September 9, 2016 Amended Decision[28], which increased the amount originally ordered to be refunded to PAL from PHP 88,542,854.00 to PHP 258,629,494.00.

The CIR moved for reconsideration from the Amended Decision, but this was rejected by the CTA Second Division in its January 9, 2017 Resolution.[29] Consequently, the CIR filed a Supplement to the Petition for Review[30] before the CTA En Banc to inveigh against the Amended Decision.

The Petitions, including the Supplement filed by the CIR, were given due course and the parties were directed to submit their respective memoranda. Thereupon, the case was deemed submitted for decision.[31]

In the challenged Decision, the CTA En Banc denied the Petitions for lack of merit and affirmed the assailed rulings of the CTA Second Division, as modified by its Amended Decision.[32] The CTA En Banc declared that PAL was able to sufficiently prove the existence of the requisites laid down under Section 13 of Presidential Decree No. 1590 in order for its importations to qualify for tax exemption. With regard to the requisite that the imported articles or goods must be used in PAL's transport and non-transport operations, the CTA En Banc held that the Authority to Release Imported Goods (ATRIGs) submitted by PAL constituted sufficient proof thereof. ATRIGs were issued by the CIR and/or his duly authorized representatives, upon verification and processing of the importation documents submitted by taxpayers and may be regarded as entries in official records which constitute prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Thus, the contents in the subject ATRIGs — to the effect that the Jet A-1 aviation fuel ""will be used exclusively for domestic flight operation"" or ""will be used exclusively for daily domestic flight operation"" — must be given weight. The ATRIGs were also further supported by the testimony of the witnesses presented by PAL.[33] As to the other requisite that aviation fuel was not legally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price during the time of importation, the CTA En Banc agreed with PAL that the Certification issued by the Air Transportation Office (ATO) to that effect was in line with its general powers under its charter. Likewise, the Certification also stood as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The CTA En Banc rejected the CIR and the COC's argument that only the DOE was in a position to determine the local availability of Jet A-1 aviation fuel.[34] The CTA En Banc also found no error on the part of the CTA Second Division when it granted PAL's motion to reopen the trial for presentation of additional evidence. It emphasized that the proceedings before the CTA were not strictly governed by the technical rules of evidence.[35]

Both the CIR and the COC moved for reconsideration, but their motions were denied in the disputed Resolution.[36]

Hence, the CIR and the COC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), instituted the present Petition,[37] arguing that the CTA En Banc erred in concluding that PAL was able to prove that the imported aviation fuel would be used for its transport and non-transport operations, and that it was not locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price.[38] They likewise maintained that in upholding the CTA Second Division's grant of PAL's motion to reopen the case for presentation of evidence, the CTA En Banc violated the well-settled rule that tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer.[39]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] oppugns the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1488 and 1494, which affirmed respondent Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL)'s entitlement to refund of the specific taxes it paid for the importation of Jet A­-1 aviation fuel between April to June of 2015, and which denied both Motions for Reconsideration[4] filed by petitioners Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and Commissioner of Customs (COC).
The facts of this case are uncomplicated.

Under its statutory franchise,[5] PAL is exempt from the payment of taxes and duties on ""all importations by the grantee of aircraft, engines, equipment, machinery, spare parts, accessories, commissary and catering supplies, aviation gas, fuel, and oil, whether refined or in crude form and other articles, supplies, or materials,""[6] as long as such articles, supplies, or materials are ""for the use of the grantee in its transport and non-transport operations and other activities incidental thereto and are not locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price.""[7] The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) confirmed PAL's exemption in its BIR Ruling No. 13-99.[8]","The Petition must fail.

At the core of this controversy is the proper interpretation and application of Section 13 (2) of Presidential Decree No. 1590, which reads:

SECTION 13. In consideration of the franchise and rights hereby granted, the grantee shall pay to the Philippine Government during the life of this franchise whichever of subsections (a) and (b) hereunder will result in a lower tax:

. . . .

The tax paid by the grantee under either of the above alternatives shall be in lieu of all other taxes, duties, royalties, registration, license, and other fees and charges of any kind, nature, or description, imposed, levied, established, assessed, or collected by any municipal, city, provincial, or national authority or government agency, now or in the future, including but not limited to the following:

. . . .

(2) All taxes, including compensating taxes, duties, charges, royalties, or fees due on all importations by the grantee of aircraft, engines, equipment, machinery, spare parts, accessories, commissary and catering supplies, aviation gas, fuel, and oil, whether refined or in crude form and other articles, supplies, or materials; provided, that such articles or supplies or materials are imported for the use of the grantee in its transport and non­ transport operations and other activities incidental thereto and are not locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price. (Emphases supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The July 26, 2018 Decision and the February 20, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1488 and 1494 are AFFIRMED."
