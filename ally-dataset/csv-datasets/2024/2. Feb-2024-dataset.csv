"G.R. No. 206985, February 28, 2024","JOSE LENI Z. SOLIDUM, PETITIONER, VS. SMART COMMUNICATIONS, INC., NAPOLEON L. NAZARENO AND RICARDO P. ISLA, RESPONDENTS.","In 2005, Solidum filed a Complaint[4] for Illegal Dismissal, Illegal Suspension, Non-payment of Salaries, Damages, and Attorney's Fees against Smart, its President and Chief Executive Officer, Napoleon Nazareno, and its former Marketing Head, Ricardo Isla. The case was docketed as NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05 (Illegal Dismissal Case).

On July 3, 2006, the arbiter rendered a Decision[5] in favor of Solidum and found that he was illegally dismissed from employment by Smart. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises all considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of complainant and against respondents, as follows:
Declaring the 20-day extended preventive suspension of complainant from October 22, 2006 to November 10, 2005 illegal and tantamount to constructive dismissal, and ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant the corresponding salaries, benefits, privileges, allowances and other incentives/bonuses during the period from October 22 to November 10, 2005, in the amount of P236,061.94;

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay the complainant's unpaid salaries, benefits, privileges, allowances, and other incentives/bonuses during the 30-day preventive suspension, in the amount of P365,896.00;

Declaring the dismissal of the complainant effective November 11, 2005 as illegal and ordering respondents to reinstate the complainant to his former position, immediately upon receipt of this decision, whether physically or in the payroll, at the option of the former, and failure to exercise their option within ten (10) days hereof shall place the complainant on payroll reinstatement, with payment of accrued salaries, allowances, benefits/incentives and bonuses;

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay him his full backwages, inclusive of all benefits, bonuses, privileges, incentives, allowances or their money equivalents from date of dismissal on November 11, 2005 until actual reinstatement, partially computed as follows:
a. Backwages & benefits -                                   P 2,903,561.79
b. Quarterly performance bonus -                       P    935,640.00
c. Monthly gas allowance  -                                 P      90,693.00

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant for the foregone opportunity of pursuing studies in the United Kingdom under the British Chevening Scholarship Award, in the sum of 20,189.00 British Pounds or Peso 1,982,727.37.

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant moral damages in the amount of P2Million, exemplary damages in the amount of P2Million and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the judgment award.","This Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to annul the Resolutions[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 115794 insofar as it ordered petitioner Jose Leni Z. Solidum (Solidum) to refund respondent Smart Communications, Inc. (Smart) the additional wages and benefits he received by virtue of the 10th Alias Writ of Execution[3] issued in NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05.","After a judicious deliberation, We find the petition meritorious.

The Court's authority in a Rule 45 Petition for Review on Certiorari is confined to addressing questions of law.[65] In this context, the present petition essentially poses the question of whether Smart may recover Solidum's wages and benefits which accrued before the NLRC's reversal of the July 3, 2006 Decision of the arbiter. This is a question of law well within the Court's purview in a Rule 45 petition.

Incidentally, the Court may nevertheless entertain the factual question of whether delay, if any, is properly attributable to Solidum or Smart. Although questions of fact are not entertained in a Rule 45 review, this admits several exceptions, such as when: (1) the findings and conclusions of the CA differ from the labor tribunals, (2) the rulings of the antecedent deciding bodies are conflicting, or (3) there is a misapprehension of facts.[66] Notably, these exceptions are all present in the instant case. The Court is thus compelled to address certain factual issues raised in this instant petition.
 
The immediately executory nature of the arbiter's decision mandates Smart to reinstate Solidum until reversal by the NLRC. Smart's non-compliance of the arbiter's order of reinstatement resulted to Solidum's unpaid wages and benefits under the 10th Alias Writ
 

An order of reinstatement issued by the labor arbiter is self-executory or immediately executory even pending appeal. In fact, this right is statutorily enshrined in the Labor Code:
In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal. The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation or, at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein.[67]
Aligning with this principle, both the 2005 and 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure (2005 NLRC Rules and 2011 NLRC Rules, respectively) specify that the perfection of an appeal suspends the execution of the labor arbiter's decision, with the exception of the reinstatement aspect pending appeal.[68] Owing to the immediately executory nature of the decision, the employer is obligated to reinstate and compensate the dismissed employee throughout the appeal process until reversal by the higher court.[69]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The November 23, 2012 and April 23, 2013 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 115794, insofar as it ordered petitioner Jose Leni Z. Solidum to refund respondent Smart Communications, Inc. the additional wages and benefits he received by virtue of the 10th Alias Writ of Execution issued by the Labor Arbiter in NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE."
"G.R. No. 249540, February 28, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. ARTURO E. VILLANUEVA, JR., RESPONDENT.","The facts as summarized by the CTA EB are as follows:
[Respondent] is engaged in the business of providing hauling services under the name Producers Connection Logistics, with registered address at No. 324 Younger St., Balut, Tondo, Manila.

. . . .

For taxable year 2006, [respondent] filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue his Annual Income Tax Return (ITR) and Quarterly VAT Returns, among other tax returns, on the dates prescribed by law.

On July 11, 2008, [respondent] received Letter Notice No. 029-WE-­I-00-00041 dated June 20, 2008. Meanwhile, on May 14, 2009, he received a follow-up letter (Tax Reconciliation System). Thereafter, on June 15, 2009, [respondent] received Letter of Authority No. 2001-00012853 dated June 8, 2009 and the First Request for Presentation of Records.

[Respondent] then received the 1st Call-up dated May 23, 2011 from Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 29 for the collection of deficiency income tax and VAT in the amounts of [PHP] 23,349,944.59 and [PHP] 7,374,006.51, respectively.

On June 21, 2011, [respondent] received a Final Notice Before Seizure (FNBS) dated June 6, 2011, issued by RDO No. 29 of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

On July 13, 2011, [respondent] sent a reply-letter to RDO No. 29, seeking clarification with regard to the 1st Call-up and FNBS, and requesting a clarification and re-investigation of his case.

On September 6, 2011, [respondent] received a letter dated August 31, 2011 from the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

[Respondent] received a Collection Notice dated October 29, 2012 from the BIR. [On November 14, 2012, respondent] then requested for the revocation of the Collection Notice . . . but the same was denied in a letter issued by [the CIR] through the Chief of Collection Division of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

On December 13, 2013, [respondent] sent a letter dated December 11, 2013 to the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila, requesting reconsideration of the denial of the request for revocation of the collection notices issued by [the CIR]. Then, on October 31, 2014, [respondent] received a letter dated October 14, 2014, issued by the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila, denying [respondent]'s request for reconsideration and reinvestigation.[7]

Accordingly, on November 25, 2014, [respondent] filed [a] Petition for Review [with the CTA Division; and the CIR filed an Answer thereto].","Before the Court is the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 13, 2019 and Resolution[3] dated September 16, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA EB) in CTA EB No. 1771, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated August 18, 2017 and Resolution[5] dated January 10, 2018 of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division (CTA Division) in CTA Case No. 8935. The CTA Division cancelled the assessments for deficiency income tax and value-added tax (VAT) for taxable year 2006 issued against respondent Arturo E. Villanueva Jr. (respondent) on the ground of prescription.[6]","The Petition lacks merit.

Preliminarily, the Court emphasizes the settled rule that findings of fact and conclusions of law by the CTA are accorded with the highest respect and will not lightly be set aside.[23] As a matter of principle, the Court will not set aside the ruling of the CTA, which is, by the very nature of its function, dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.[24] Findings and conclusions of the CTA can only be disturbed on appeal if they are not supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the CTA—these are not present in this case. 
 
The CIR failed to prove that the assessment notices were properly served and received by respondent
 

Section 228 of the 1997 NIRC, as implemented by Revenue Regulation No. 12-99,[25] outlines the due process requirements for the issuance of deficiency tax assessments. In the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc.[26] (Avon), the Court summarized these requirements as follows:
. . . Under Section 228, it is explicitly required that the taxpayer be informed in writing of the law and of the facts on which the assessment is made; otherwise, the assessment shall be void. Section 3.1.2 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 requires the Preliminary Assessment Notice to show in detail the facts and law, rules and regulations, or jurisprudence on which the proposed assessment is based. Further, Section 3.1.4 requires that the Final Letter of Demand must state the facts and law on which it is based; otherwise, the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices themselves shall be void. Finally, Section 3.1.6 specifically requires that the decision of the Commissioner or of his or her duly authorized representative on a disputed assessment shall state the facts and law, rules and regulations, or jurisprudence on which the decision is based. Failure to do so would invalidate the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment.

. . . .

On the other hand, the taxpayer is explicitly given the opportunity to explain or present his or her side throughout the process, from tax investigation through tax assessment. Under Section 3.1.1 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, the taxpayer is given 15 days from receipt of the Notice for Informal Conference to respond; otherwise, he or she will be considered in default and the case will be referred to the Assessment Division for appropriate review and issuance of deficiency tax assessment, if warranted. Again, under Section 228 of the Tax Code and Section 3.1.2 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, the taxpayer is required to respond within 15 days from receipt of the Preliminary Assessment Notice; otherwise, he or she will be considered in default and the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices will be issued. After receipt of the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices, the taxpayer is given 30 days to file a protest, and subsequently, to appeal his or her protest to the Court of Tax Appeals.[27]
Essentially, to comply with the requirements of due process, the CIR is required to inform the taxpayer of the factual and legal bases of the deficiency tax assessment and provide him or her the opportunity to protest such assessment, present his or her case, and adduce supporting evidence.[28] Avon further underscored that the CIR must give due consideration to the taxpayer's evidence and explanation; otherwise, the right to be heard is rendered meaningless.[29] Certainly, as ""between the power of the State to tax and an individual's right to due process, the scale favors the right of the taxpayer to due process.""[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated March 13, 2019 and Resolution dated September 16, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1771 are hereby AFFIRMED."
" G.R. No. 262579, February 28, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROSSANO SAMSON Y TIONGCO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information charging accused-appellant with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for killing Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre (Abegail). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:

That on or about the 8th day of October, 2014, in the municipality of Norzagaray, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with crowbar (bareta) and with intent to kill one Abegail Tobias y dela Torre, eleven (11) years old minor, with abuse of superior strength and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault and hit said Abegail Tobias y dela Torre with the said crowbar on the different parts of her body which directly caused the instantaneous death of the said Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the charge.[5]

Trial on the merits ensued.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated April 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14958 that affirmed the Decision[3] dated July 20, 2020, of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malolos City, Bulacan in Criminal Case No. 4160-M-2014. The RTC found Rossano Samson y Tiongco (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

It is settled that the factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and respect, especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court.[29] Findings of the trial court that are factual in nature and that involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded respect, if not finality, by the appellate court when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gleaned from such findings.[30] The trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies because of ""its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination.""[31]

Upon a judicious perusal of the records of the case, there is no compelling reason to depart from the ruling of the RTC and the CA that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.

The Court affirms the ruling of both the RTC and the CA that the totality of the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to hold accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The Court likewise holds that the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly admitted the extrajudicial confession of accused-appellant.

The RTC convicted accused-appellant of Murder qualified by treachery and abuse of superior strength.[32] Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code states:

ART. 248. Murder. — Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua, to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:

With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity[.]
The elements of Murder are the following: ""(a) that a person was killed; (b) that the accused killed him [/her]; (c) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248; and (d) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.""[33]

Here, all the elements of Murder are present. Accused-appellant killed Abegail. The killing was neither parricide nor infanticide. However, it must be clarified that the killing of Abegail was qualified by treachery only; the circumstance of abuse of superior strength is deemed absorbed by treachery.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated April 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14958 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Rossano Samson y Tiongco is hereby found GUILTY of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 4160-M-2014 filed with Branch 18, Regional Trial Court, Malolos City, Bulacan. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and is likewise ORDERED to pay the heirs of Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre the following:

PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity;
PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages;
PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and
PHP 50,570.00 as actual damages.
All monetary awards shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment."
"A.M. No. 15-05-50-MCTC, February 28, 2024","IN RE: INCORRECT ENTRIES IN THE DAILY TIME RECORD OF MS. LORNA M. MARTIN, COURT STENOGRAPHER I, MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURT (MCTC), STA. IGNACIA-MAYANTOC-SAN CLEMENTE-SAN JOSE, TARLAC","In a 1st Endorsement[4] dated May 26, 2015, Martin was required to comment on Judge Gandia-Asuncion's letter. Martin submitted her Comment[5] on September 16, 2015.

Martin vehemently denied the allegations against her. She claimed that she reported for work on August 11, 2014 and in the morning of May 6, 2014. She averred that in the latter instance, she realized that she forgot to write her name and merely rectified the same by writing it that same afternoon. She nevertheless admitted that she refused to comply with the order for her to go to Judge Gandia-Asuncion's chambers and explain, justifying that she was not feeling well and was the assigned stenographer for that day. Martin maintained that OIC Clerk of Court Rodelio A. Pedroche (OIC-COC Pedroche) was motivated by ill feelings towards her. She also accused her officemates who attested against her and Judge Gandia-Asuncion of not performing their duties properly. She averred that they are the ones who are always absent but reflected otherwise in their DTRs. Martin asserted that Judge Gandia-Asuncion had been ""so unfair"" to her in the past forcing her to work even though she is sick, that is why she refused to receive nor read the Memorandum issued to her by the former.[6]

The Court, in its Resolution[7] dated April 18, 2018, referred the administrative matter to Judge Rixon M. Garong (Judge Garong) of Branch 37, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lingayen, Pangasinan, for investigation, report, and recommendation as Acting Presiding Judge of the RTC, Branch 68, Camiling, Tarlac pursuant to Administrative Order No. 217-2017 dated December 27, 2017.

Judge Garong required Judge Gandia-Asuncion and the other complainants who joined her namely: OIC-COC Pedroche, Genelyn C. Gragasin, Maranatha Gracel A. Lardizabal, Von A. Villanueva, Dioso S. Tomas, and Maynard L. Millado, all of whom are employees of the MCTC of Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, to respond to Martin's Comment dated August 20, 2015; and for Martin to file her sworn Rejoinder thereto.

Judge Gandia-Asuncion submitted her Comment with annexes on July 31, 2018, whereas the rest of the complainants filed their sworn separate comment on August 1, 2018. During the date set for conference, Martin manifested that she will no longer file a rejoinder.[8]

On October 2, 2018, Judge Garong submitted his Investigation Report,[9] recommending on the basis of his investigation:

From the foregoing, the undersigned found LORNA M. MARTIN to be liable for tampering records, specifically the logbook on 6 May 2014 entries. Similarly, she can be held liable for the same infractions committed on 16 May 2014 and 11 August 2014.

Also, based on the foregoing facts as supported by sworn statements by MCTC personnel, respondent LORNA M. MARTIN exhibited insubordination to lawful orders not only from [Judge Gandia-Asuncion] but also from her OIC-Clerk of Court.

Hence, it is recommended that the appropriate disciplinary sanctions commensurate to her infractions be imposed on [Martin].","In a letter[1] dated September 3, 2014 addressed to the Office of Court Administrator (OCA), signed by Judge Stela Marie Q. Gandia-Asuncion (Judge Gandia-Asuncion) of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, that Ms. Lorna M. Martin (Martin), Court Stenographer I of the same court, was reported for her incorrect declarations in her Daily Time Record (DTR) for August and May 2014.
Specifically, Judge Gandia-Asuncion informed the OCA that she signed Martin's DTR for the said months ""with reservation"" as the latter entered in the Registry Book of Attendance (logbook) that on August 11, 2014, she arrived at 1:00 p.m. and left at 5:00 p.m., when she did not report for work that afternoon.[2] The incident happened again on May 6, 2014, wherein Martin logged that she arrived in the office at 8:00 a.m. and left at 12:00 p.m. when in fact, she was not present that morning. Judge Gandia-Asuncion also noted that Martin made incorrect entries in the logbook on May 16, 2014.[3]","The Court in A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC, amended the Rules of Court and included personnel of the lower courts within the coverage of Rule 140.[27] The penalty to be imposed upon Martin shall then be in accordance with such Rule. Section 14, of Rule 140 classifies gross misconduct and serious dishonesty, as well as gross insubordination as serious charges.

Under Section 17 of the same Rule, a respondent found guilty of a serious charge shall be imposed with any of the following sanctions:

Section 17. Sanctions. -

(1) If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:

(a) Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;

(b) Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one year; or

(c) A fine of more than [PHP] 100,000.00 but not exceeding [PHP] 200,000.00.

Considering that Martin is guilty of multiple offenses, Section 21 of Rule 140 applies as to the imposable penalty. Section 21 reads:

SECTION 21. Penalty for Multiple Offenses. - If the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense. Should the aggregate of the imposed penalties exceed five (5) years of suspension or [PHP] 1,000,000.00 in fines, the respondent may, in the discretion of the Supreme Court, be meted with the penalty of dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as may be determined, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.

On the other hand, is a single act/omission constitutes more than one (1) offense, the respondent shall still be found liable for all such offenses, but shall nonetheless, only be meted with the appropriate penalty for the most serious offense.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Lorna M. Martin, Court Stenographer I of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, GUILTY of Serious Dishonesty and Gross Misconduct, for which she is ordered to pay a FINE of PHP 200,000.00. Martin is also found GUILTY of Gross Insubordination and is meted out the penalty of FINE of PHP 110,000.00."
"A.M. No. MTJ-23-019 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-043-MTJ], February 27, 2024","RICHARD CARINGAL, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE CORNELIO A. SY, PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENT.","Caringal essentially alleged that Claveria and Culla borrowed PHP 500,000.00 from him secured by a promissory note and a Kasunduan dated December 15, 2015. When Claveria and Culla failed to pay, he brought the matter to the office of the barangay. There, the parties signed an agreement denominated as ""PAGHAHARAP"" where Claveria and Culla agreed to pay their PHP 500,000.00 loan.[2]

Despite this agreement, Claveria and Culla continued to default in their payment. Consequently, he (Caringal) obtained from the barangay a certificate to file action against them. On July 7, 2017, he filed with the Municipal Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro (single sala) (MTC) a petition for a writ of execution to enforce the terms of the aforesaid PAGHARARAP. On November 13, 2018, Judge Sy, as presiding judge, dismissed the complaint in view of the supposed doubtful veracity of the barangay documents attached to the petition.[3]

On appeal, the RTC reversed and held that pursuant to Section 417 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, an amicable settlement or arbitration award may be executed at the level of the Lupon within six months from the date of the settlement. Thereafter, the settlement may be enforced by filing the appropriate action before the court. The RTC thus remanded the case to the MTC, San Jose, for the issuance of a writ of execution against Claveria and Culla; and to enforce the parties' agreement or PAGHAHARAP.[4]

On May 17, 2021, Caringal went back to the MTC for the implementation of the foregoing decision. Per his Order dated May 20, 2021, Judge Sy granted his motion for issuance of writ of execution, and in his subsequent Order set the case for ""Pre-Execution Conference"" on October 18, 2021.[5]

Caringal did not attend the pre-execution conference despite notice. He claims though that during the conference, Judge Sy influenced his (Caringal's) counsel, Atty. Luminate, to accept the PHP 500,000.00 cash offered by Claveria and Culla as full satisfaction of his claim despite Atty. Luminate's alleged lack of special authority to enter into any kind of compromise agreement on his behalf. While PHP 500,000.00 was the full amount of the principal loan, interest was also due him from Claveria and Culla.[6]

Lastly, upon learning that his (Caringal) counsel, Atty. Luminate, accepted the PHP 500,000.00, he filed a protest-letter before the MTC. He denied giving Atty. Luminate authority to accept the PHP 500,000.00, sans payment of interest, on his behalf.[7]","Complainant Richard Caringal (Caringal) charged respondent Judge Cornelio A. Sy (Judge Sy) with gross misconduct, gross incompetence, and gross ignorance of the law for allegedly allowing Atty. Darwin Luminate (Atty. Luminate) to enter into a compromise agreement with Marcelo Claveria (Claveria) and Delia Culla (Culla) in Civil Case No. 1671 without a special power of attorney from Caringal himself as the winning party; and declaring Civil Case No. 1671 closed and terminated notwithstanding that the final and executory judgment issued by Branch 46, Regional Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro (RTC) has not been fully satisfied yet.[1]","
Judge Sy is not guilty of gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, or gross incompetence
 

To begin with, the present administrative action is premised on the erroneous notion that there was a reduction of the judgment amount during the execution stage and that it was pursued by Judge Sy, albeit complainant's lawyer then present did not supposedly bear the client's authority to compromise the case.

To clarify, the subject agreement denominated as PAGHAHARAP states:
i. The parties would continue to respect their agreement executed before Notary Public Atty. Alfredo A. Castillo;

ii. Defendant Claveria would pay the debt in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand [PHP] 500,000.00) Pesos in favor of [the] [Caringal][30]

....
Further, the writ of execution provides:[31]","ACCORDINGLY, the Administrative Complaint against respondent Judge Cornelio A. Sy, Presiding Judge, Municipal Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro is DISMISSED for utter lack of merit.

"G.R. No. 226138, February 27, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS (DPWH), PETITIONER, VS. ESPINA & MADARANG, CO. AND MAKAR AGRICULTURAL CORP., RESPONDENTS.","In an undated letter, Vincente L. Olarte (Vincente), as attorney-in-fact of the Olarte Hermanos y Cia Estate (Olartes), wrote to the regional director of the DPWH, Region XII, Cotabato City to claim Road Right of Way (RROW) compensation for Lots A, G, and F, Plan Lot SC-6834, Subdivision Plan SWO-12-000103, located along the National Highway, General Santos City (subject property).[4] The subject property involved a 3.5-kilometer road with an area of approximately 186,856 square meters that was taken by the government for public use as it was traversed by the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway.[5]

The DPWH then received the June 4, 2007 Order from Branch 14, Regional Trial Court of Cotabato City (RTC), in relation to a case docketed as Spec Proc. No. 2004-074 entitled ""In Re: Matter of Insolvencia Voluntaria de [Olarte] Hermanos [y] Cia, Heirs of the late Alberto P. Olarte, etc."" The said Order enjoined the DPWH to pay the RROW claim of the Olartes. On November 13, 2007, an Order was again issued instructing DPWH to release the partial payment in the amount of PHP 44,891,140.65 within 10 days from notice. As such, the DPWH began paying the Olartes in installment.[6]

On May 7, 2008, Espina and Makar filed a Complaint (With [prayer for a] temporary restraining order)[7] docketed as Civil Case No. 7788 against the heirs of Alberto Pelayo Olarte and Jose Pelayo Olarte (heirs of Olarte), the DPWH, and the Register of Deeds of General Santos City. They alleged that Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 12 registered in the name of Olarte Hermanos, under which the heirs of Olarte were laying claim to the RROW compensation, had been mortgaged to El Hogar Filipino (El Hogar). Due to nonpayment of the loan, the subject property was sold at public auction and OCT No. 12 was cancelled. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 886 was issued in favor of El Hogar who then sold the subject property to the Espina sisters, namely, Salud, Soledad, Mercedes, and Asuncion. Thus, TCT No. 886 was cancelled and TCT No. (T-635)(T-19)T-2 was issued in favor of the Espina sisters. In 1949, Asuncion sold her share to Soledad and TCT No. (T0636)(T-20)T-3 was issued in the name of Salud, Mercedes, and Asuncion. In 1958, the subject property was sold to Makar and TCT No. (T-5288)(T-433)T-118 was issued in its favor. Makar then sold a 195.18-hectare portion of the subject property to Espina which, in turn, subdivided it into 600 lots, 300 of which had already been sold. Of the 300 lots sold, 67 were already in the names of the vendees.[8]

The RTC granted a 72-hour Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). Subsequently, in its June 24, 2008 Order, it issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) in Civil Case No. 7788.[9]

The DPWH filed a ""Manifestation and Motion (in lieu of Answer),""[10] alleging, among others, that it had already made payments to the heirs of Olarte upon the latter's representation that they owned the subject property. Considering the dispute on the ownership of the subject property, the DPWH manifested that it would support any proceeding that would settle the issue and that it would cease from paying the heirs of Olarte until it was resolved.[11]

Meanwhile, Espina and Makar filed a Manifestation to render Civil Case No. 7788 moot and academic in view of the July 22, 2009 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN[12] entitled ""Espina & Madarang, Co. & Makar Agricultural Corp., represented by Rodrigo A. Adtoon v. Hon. Cedar P. Indar Al Haj, Judge"" They insisted that in the said Decision, the CA affirmed their ownership over the subject property.[13] CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN was an offshoot of Spec Pro. No. 2004-074.[14]

On October 5, 2009, the RTC issued an Order[15] in Civil Case No. 7788 ruling that the injunction case was already moot and academic in view of the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN.[16] It also upheld Espina and Makar's ownership over the subject property and ordered the DPWH to pay their RROW compensation claim.[17]","This Court resolves a Motion for Partial Reconsideration[1] filed by respondents Espina and Madarang, Co. (Espina) and Makar Agricultural Corp. (Makar) assailing this Court's Decision,[2] which partly granted the Petition of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), through the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The dispositive portion of the Decision states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered[,] the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 25, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 22, 2016 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION to read as follows:

The Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch 36 in Civil Case No. 7788 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE in so far as they directed the Sheriff to reimplement the Writ of Execution dated June 2, 2010 and to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to the respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp., or to the court whatever funds money, or assets of the Department of Public Works and Highways susceptible to execution found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment in favor of the respondents.

Respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. are hereby enjoined to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the Road Right of Way compensation.","
This Court may exercise its discretion to entertain the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of respondents
The doctrine of immutability of judgments holds that ""a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law.""[80] Nevertheless, this doctrine is not an iron-clad rule as it is subject to several recognized exceptions such as:

(1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[81] (Citation omitted)

In the past, this Court has also recognized other exceptions to the rule on immutability of judgments and ordered the recall of the entries in the interest of substantial justice and where there are special and compelling reasons that warrant such actions.[82]

Considering that petitioner no longer filed a motion for reconsideration to challenge the March 23, 2022 Decision, this Court shall now focus on the arguments raised in the Motion for Partial Reconsideration. After taking a second hard look, this Court finds that the instruction in the March 23, 2022 Decision that the claim for just compensation be brought to the COA is worth revisiting.

Here, respondents argue that despite the finality of this Court's Decision on March 23, 2022, their Motion for Partial Reconsideration should still be entertained due to a circumstance made known after it was promulgated. Invoking the fourth exception enumerated above, they maintain that the execution of the ruling of this Court's Decision, particularly the instruction to file a money claim before the COA for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the RROW compensation, has become unjust and inequitable, if not impossible, due to the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008.[83]

Admittedly, the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008 transpired prior to the promulgation of this Court's Decision. Nonetheless, this Court is not precluded from exercising its discretion to entertain the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of respondents. In exercising discretion, this Court is guided by the tenets of justice and fair play, bearing in mind the circumstances obtaining in each case.[84] Here, this Court finds it appropriate to exercise this prerogative and resolve the compelling arguments raised in the Motion for Partial Reconsideration in light of the crucial consequence of the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008 to the directive of this Court in the March 23, 2022 Decision, and in the interest of substantial justice. After all, the purpose of the rules of procedure is to facilitate the attainment of justice. When the strict and rigid application of the rules of procedure frustrates rather than promotes the efficient delivery of justice, this Court may suspend the rules in favor of substantial justice.[85]","ACCORDINGLY, the Motion for Partial Reconsideration is GRANTED. The March 23, 2022 Decision of this Court is MODIFIED. Respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. are entitled to receive just compensation equivalent to PHP 218,839,455.00. This Court imposes interest at the rate of 12% per annum from June 30, 2007 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.

The portion of the assailed Decision enjoining respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the Road Right of Way compensation is DELETED."

a)
ND No. 10-001-717(08) dated March 12, 2010 was issued disallowing the Withholding Tax Portion of the Productivity Incentive Bonus for calendar year (CY) 2008 in the amount of PHP 12,758,649.75 received by PHIC on March 29, 2010;

On August 24, 2010, PHIC filed its Consolidated Memorandum of Appeal before the Commission on Audit-Corporate Government Sector (COA-CGS), assailing the issuance of the NDs.","This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court filed by the petitioner Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), which seeks to set aside the December 28, 2016 Decision No. 2016-474[2] and the January 31, 2020 Resolution No. 2020-405[3] of the Commission on Audit (COA) for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The assailed Decision denied the Petition for Review filed by the PHIC for having been filed out of time and for lack of merit. The assailed Resolution denied the PHIC's Motion for Reconsideration.","The Court upholds the COA Decision.

An appeal made before the COA Proper must be filed within the six-month period
The Revised Rules of Procedures of the Commission on Audit (RRPC) prescribes the period for filing appeals before the COA Proper. The six-month period finds basis in Rule VII, Section 3 of the RRPC as follows:

SEC. 3. Period of Appeal. — The appeal shall be taken within the time remaining of the six (6) months period under Section 4, Rule V, taking into account the suspension of the running thereof under Section 5 of the same Rule in case of appeals from the Director's decision, or under Sections 9 and 10 of Rule VI in case of decision of the [Adjudication and Settlement Board].

Parenthetically, Rule V, Section 4 of the RRPC provides as follows:

SEC. 4. When Appeal Taken. — An Appeal must be filed within six (6) months after receipt of the decision appealed from.

Here, the PHIC received ND Nos. 0-001-717(08) and 10-002-725(09) on March 29, 2010 and ND No. 10-003-725(09) on April 14, 2010. However, the Petition for Review was only filed before the COA Proper on July 13, 2012. Taking into consideration the tolling of the period to appeal when PHIC filed its Memorandum of Appeal with the COA Director until PHIC's receipt of its resolution, the Petition for Review was only filed 199 days after receiving ND Nos. 0-001-717(08) and 10-002-725(09), and 183 days after receiving ND No. 10-003-725(09).[21] Hence, PHIC's appeal was perfected beyond the six-month or the 180-day reglementary period.

It is hornbook doctrine that the right to appeal is a mere statutory right and anyone who seeks to invoke such privilege must apply with the applicable rules; otherwise, the right to appeal is forfeited.[22] In this case, the right to appeal must comply with the RRPC, which was crafted to ensure the orderly disposition of cases.[23]

To give the impression that the Petition for Review before the COA Proper was timely filed, PHIC maintains that under the Civil Code, the word ""month"" is understood to mean ""thirty days,"" and that unless a specific reference is made to a month, it shall be understood to mean that the same consists of 30 days.[24] Applying this logic, PHIC proposed the following computation of the period:

March 29 – 30, 2010	=	2 days
 	 	 
April 1 – 30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
May 1–30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
June 1 –30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
July 1 – 30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
August 1 – 24, 2010	=	24 days
 	 	 
May 23 – 30, 2012	=	8 days
 	 	 
June 1 – 26, 2012	=	26 days
 	 	 
Total	=	180 days
On June 26, 2012, PHIC filed its Motion for Extension to file its Petition for Review before the COA Proper. On July 13, 2012, PHIC finally filed its Petition for Review.

A simple reading of the proposed computation of PHIC would reveal that it disregarded the fact that the months of March, May, and July all have 31 days. The proposed computation also conveniently gives the impression that PHIC was able to comply within the required period, filing its Motion for Extension on the alleged last day of the reglementary period.

The Court is not persuaded.

The Court has already settled in PHIC v. COA, et al.[25] that the six-month period provided in Rule V, Section 4 of the RRPC must be understood to mean 180 days as follows:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Commission on Audit's Decision No. 2016-474 dated December 28, 2016 is AFFIRMED."
"A.M. No. 23-07-26-SC, February 27, 2024",RE: POST OF ATTY. ERWIN ERFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA ACCUSING THE COURT OF JUDICIAL TYRANNY,"On July 11, 2023, the Court in its Resolution in A.M. No. 25-05-05-SC, Re: Request of the Public Attorney's Office to Delete Section 22, Canon III of the Proposed Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, denied the said request of the Public Attorney's Office (PAO). The Court likewise directed Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta (Atty. Acosta), Chief of the PAO, to show cause why she should not be cited in indirect contempt and disciplined as a member of the Bar for her public statements on social media and other actions in relation to the said request of the PAO.

When the Court's ruling in its July 11, 2023 Resolution was disseminated to the public through a press release, Atty. Erfe posted on his Facebook account the following statement: ""The Supreme Court's threat to cite in contempt the PAO Chief for defending the PAO cannot be called any other name other than judicial tyranny"" (Facebook post).[3]

For this reason, the Court issued the Resolution, dated July 25, 2023. The Court stated that ""Atty. Erfe's public characterization of the Court's action as 'judicial tyranny' degrades the administration of justice, as contemplated in Section 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court,"" which tended ""to bring the authority of the Court into disrepute.""[4] Atty. Erfe was likewise ordered to show cause why he should not be disciplinary dealt with as a member of the Bar for violating the CPRA.[5]

In his Verified Compliance,[6] Atty. Erfe submitted his Most Humble Apology,[7] dated August 24, 2023,[8] expressing his ""most heartfelt and sincere apology to [the Justices of the Court], to the Supreme Court, and the entire judiciary.""

Atty. Erfe explained that the Facebook post was ""spurred by the uncontrollable and sudden emotional feeling that [he] felt"" upon learning about the denial of the PAO's request to delete Section 22, Canon III and the show cause order against Atty. Acosta. He averred that he later realized that he should not have been overcome by emotions and thus deleted the Facebook post. He added that he saw the rationale behind Section 22, Canon III and expressed his intention to fully comply with the said provision.[9]","This resolves the Verified Compliance (Re: Show Cause Order dated 25 July 2023)[1] filed by respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe (Atty. Erfe) in response to the Court's Resolution,[2] dated July 25, 2023, in which the Court directed him to show cause why he should not be cited in indirect contempt and why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Sections 2, 14, and 19 of Canon II of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","Atty. Erfe is guilty of indirect contempt

The Court holds that Atty. Erfe's Facebook post amounts to ""improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice,"" punishable as indirect contempt under Section 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.

Time and again, the Court, when confronted with actions and statements that tend to promote distrust and undermine public confidence in the Judiciary, has not hesitated to wield its inherent power to cite persons in contempt.[10] In so doing, the Court preserves the Judiciary's honor and dignity and the trust and confidence of the public which is critical for the stability of democratic government.[11]

Here, Atty. Erfe, without providing any basis in fact or law, accused the Court of tyranny for ordering Atty. Acosta to show cause why she should not be cited in contempt. Atty. Erfe's statement, which suggested that the Court, in exercising its contempt power, acted in an oppressive manner, impaired public confidence in the Court and, consequently, degraded the administration of justice. It is an unwarranted attack on the dignity of the Court constitutive of indirect contempt.

At this juncture, the Court underscores the importance of maintaining the people's trust in the Judiciary, particularly, the Court. If the public loses their confidence in the Court, which is the last bulwark to which the Filipino people may repair to obtain relief for their grievances or protection of their rights when these are trampled upon, and believe that they cannot expect justice from the Court, they might be driven to take the law into their hands, and disorder and perhaps chaos might be the result.[12]

This is not to say that the courts are sacrosanct and thus should be shielded from any form of criticism. In People v. Godoy,[13] the Court explained that fair criticism of a court's rulings or decisions is not improper. So long as critics confine their criticisms to facts and base them on the decisions of the court, they commit no contempt no matter how severe the criticism may be; but when they pass beyond that line and charge that judicial conduct was influenced by improper, corrupt, or selfish motives, or that such conduct was affected by political prejudice or interest, the tendency is to create distrust and destroy the confidence of the people in their courts. Clearly, Atty. Erfe's derogatory remark against the Court falls outside the ambit of fair criticism.

What makes the present case more reprehensible is that the contumacious statement came from a member of the Bar, who as an officer of the court, has the sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts that is so essential to the proper administration of justice. Thus, Atty. Erfe must likewise be disciplined as a member of the Bar.

Atty. Erfe violated Sections 2, 14, and 19, Canon II of CPRA","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court finds respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe GUILTY of indirect contempt of court and orders him to PAY a FINE of PHP 10,000.00. The Court further finds him GUILTY of grossly undignified conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and violation of the sub judice rule and he is REPRIMANDED with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

Let copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe, to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and to the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their guidance and information.

"A.M. No. P-14-3223 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 10-3344-P), February 27, 2024","LEONILA V. BELTRAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. RAINERIA S. PABICA, STENOGRAPHER I/ACTING CLERK OF COURT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, PALOMPON, LEYTE, RESPONDENT.","In her Letter-Complaint[1] dated December 23, 2009, Leonila V. Beltran (Beltran) essentially averred:

She was one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 461 entitled ""Matilde Marilao-Canson, et. al. v. Leonila V. Beltran, et. al."" for Recovery of Possession and Ownership with Damages and Attorney's Fees filed before the Municipal Trial Court of Palompon, Leyte (MTC) where respondent Raineria S. Pabica (Pabica) was then its Court Stenographer I and Acting Clerk of Court at the same time.[2]

Initially, Atty. Raymund B. Samson (Atty. Samson) of the Public Attorney's Office represented Beltran and the other co-defendants in the case. But after the hearing held on April 20, 2005, Pabica approached Beltran to convince the latter to hire another lawyer, Atty. Camilo P. Esmero (Atty. Esmero), in lieu of Atty. Samson. Beltran had reservations regarding Atty. Esmero because said counsel had previously represented the same plaintiffs in another case and had even notarized certain documents which formed part of the plaintiff's evidence-in-chief in Civil Case No. 461. Beltran nonetheless, followed Pabica's instructions relying on the latter's supposed knowledge on the qualifications of legal practitioners in Palompon, Leyte.[3]

On September 20, 2007, Pabica informed her by phone that the decision in Civil Case No. 461 was forthcoming, and that could help them in obtaining a favorable judgment in exchange for PHP 15,000.00. Beltran agreed. Thus, in the evening of that day, Pabica came to Beltran's house to collect the payment. Upon Beltran's request, Pabica signed a receipt. As it was, however, the MTC ruled against Beltran and the other defendants.[4]

Beltran contacted Pabica regarding the adverse decision. Pabrica appeased Beltran by telling the latter that the MTC decision would be appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Palompon, Leyte (RTC). In its Order dated August 28, 2008, Branch 17 of the RTC dismissed the appeal citing several basic and material flaws in the Memorandum submitted by the defendant-appellants, through their counsel, Atty. Esmero, including the failure to assign errors allegedly committed by the MTC in the assailed decision, as well as the erroneous prayer for the dismissal of the appeal for lack of basis.[5]

After informing Pabica of the aforesaid order of dismissal, the latter adviced Beltran to file a motion for reconsideration with the Regional Trial Court and, thereafter, an appeal before the Court of Appeals should the said motion be denied. Pabica then told Beltran that the filing fee for the motion for reconsideration would cost around PHP 4,000.00. Beltran turned over this amount to Pabica on September 8, 2008 around 9:00 p.m. at the Palompon Public Cemetery. The turnover was witnessed by several persons. Upon verification, Beltran learned that the motion for reconsideration was denied for being filed 42 days late. According to Beltran, Pabica deliberately caused the belated filing of the said motion.[6]","Under Rule 140, Section 14(a) and (n), in relation to Section 17 of the Rules of Court, as amended, gross insubordination and gross misconduct are classified as serious charges warranting (a) dismissal from service; (b) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; and (c) disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, viz.:","The Court resolves to adopt and approve the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendation of the Judicial Integrity Board in its Report dated January 25, 2023.

First. Pabica violated Canon IV, Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel[17] (CCCP) when she meddled with Civil Case No. 461 by convincing complainant to engage the legal services of Atty. Esmero as her handling lawyer, in lieu of Atty. Samson. Thus, the acts of Pabica are even more pernicious, given that Atty. Esmero's acceptance of complainant's case appears to violate the prohibition against conflict of interest under Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18.

Canon IV, Section 5 of the CCCP explicitly ordains that court personnel shall not recommend private attorneys to litigants.[18] Notably, Pabica did not merely recommend, but even convinced complainant and her co-defendants to change their attorney and hire Atty. Esmero to replace Atty. Samson. Worse, Pabica, as the Acting Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court, could not have been unaware that Atty. Esmero had previously represented complainant's opponents in another case before the same court and even notarized documents forming part of the evidence-in-chief of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 461.

In Office of the Court Administrator v. Buzon,[19] the Court found that a court stenographer committed grave misconduct for assisting a party-litigant to find legal representation, viz.:

Likewise, respondent claims that she was merely assisting Tablante in finding a new defense lawyer does not legitimize her actions. Canon IV, Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel prohibits court personnel from recommending private attorneys to litigants, prospective litigants, or anyone dealing with the judiciary. While court employees are not totally prohibited from rendering aid to others, they should see to it that the assistance, albeit involving acts unrelated to their official functions, does not in any way compromise the public's trust in the justice system. Clearly, by assisting Tablante in finding legal representation, respondent violated ethical rules.

Respondent's action is all the more malevolent considering that Tablante has a pending case with the court where she is a stenographer. Their interaction gave the appearance that the court is partial to Tablante's cause. As an employee of the judiciary, respondent should have maintained a neutral attitude in dealing with party-litigants. If it were true that Tablante insisted on asking for her assistance, respondent should have severed any form of communication with her. However, instead of distancing herself, respondent even agreed to meet Tablante after the latter represented that she already gathered funds to pay for a lawyer. Certainly, respondent's deliberate acts are inconsistent with her claim that she was merely a victim of frame-up.

Thus, respondent should be held accountable for grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.[20]

Pabica, too, is accountable for grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.","ACCORDINGLY, Raineria S. Pabica is found GUILTY of Gross Misconduct and Gross Insubordination in violation of Canon I, Sections 1 and 2, and Canon IV, Section 5. In view of her compulsory retirement on December 30, 2019, the Court ORDERS the FORFEITURE of her retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.

Further, the Court DIRECTS the Integrated Bar of the Philippines to conduct an investigation and submit its report and recommendation on the acts of Atty. Camilo P. Esmero which may constitute a violation of the prohibition against Conflict of Interest under Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18.

Let a copy of this Decision be served on Raineria S. Pabica at her last known address at Sitio San Martin, Brgy. San Isidro, Palompon, Leyte."

On June 7, 2023, the Court received another Letter,[6] dated June 6, 2023, from the PAO reiterating concerns regarding Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA and seeking a dialogue with Chief Justice Gesmundo.

In the Resolution,[7] dated July 11, 2023, the Court resolved to deny the PAO's request that Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA be deleted. It ruled that the CPRA was promulgated by the Court in the exercise not only of its power to regulate the practice of law, but also of its constitutional prerogative to promulgate rules concerning legal assistance to the underprivileged. Noting that the PAO's principal mandate is to provide free legal assistance to indigents, the Court rejected the PAO's contention that it should be treated like a regular law firm. The Court also found no merit in the PAO's claim that Section 22, Canon III singles out the poor and that it is ""antithetical to adequate legal assistance"" and poses a ""serious threat"" to the right to speedy disposition of cases, emphasizing that the policy behind the new rule is to promote the poor's access to legal assistance by limiting the imputation of conflict of interest to public attorneys who had actual participation in the case. The Court found the alleged inconsistencies pointed out by the PAO between the assailed rule, on the one hand, and Republic Act No. 9406[8] and the 2021 PAO Revised Operations Manual, on the other hand, to be more apparent than real.[9]

In the same Resolution, the Court noted and expressed concern over Atty. Acosta's disturbing actions in relation to her opposition to the proposed new conflict of interest rule for the PAO, which eventually became Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA. In several public posts on her page on the social media platform Facebook, Atty. Acosta appealed to the public to stand against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA and maligned the Court for adopting the said rule. Atty. Acosta also launched a public campaign against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA by posting on the same social media platform several videos of the PAO lawyers, employees, and clients declaring their disagreement with the rule. Moreover, Atty. Acosta publicized the contents of the PAO's letters to Chief Justice Gesmundo against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA through different forms of media.[10]","Before the Court are the Very Respectful Verified Compliance (Re: Show-Cause Order dated 11 July 2023)[1] (First Compliance) and Very Respectful Verified Compliance (Re: Show-Cause Order dated 25 July 2023)[2] (Second Compliance) filed by Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta (Atty. Acosta), the Chief of the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), in response to the Court's Resolutions,[3] dated July 11, 2023 and July 25, 2023. The Court, motu proprio, required Atty. Acosta to show cause why she should not be cited in indirect contempt and be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Sections 2, 14, and 42, Canon II and Section 2, Canon III of A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","
Atty. Acosta is guilty of indirect contempt
Contempt is defined as a disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice and dignity. It signifies not only a willful disregard or disobedience of the court's orders, but such conduct which tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or in some manner to impede the due administration of justice. It is a conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or to interfere with or prejudice parties-litigant or their witnesses during litigation.[24]

In Tallado v. Racoma,[25] the Court discussed the nature of and rationale behind the courts' authority to penalize contempt of court:

The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts, and need not be specifically granted by statute. It lies at the core of the administration of a judicial system. Indeed, there ought to be no question that courts have the power by virtue of their very creation to impose silence, respect, and decorum in their presence, submission to their lawful mandates, and to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution. The power to punish for contempt essentially exists for the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and for the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of the courts, and, consequently, for the due administration of justice. The reason behind the power to punish for contempt is that respect of the courts guarantees the stability of their institution; without such guarantee, the institution of the courts would be resting on a very shaky foundation.[26] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

In Fortune Life Insurance Co., Inc. v. Commission on Audit,[27] the Court underscored that for the Court and all other courts of the land to be able to administer and dispense evenhanded justice, they should be free from harassment and disrespect.

There are two (2) types of contempt of court: (i) direct contempt; and (ii) indirect contempt. As defined by jurisprudence, direct contempt is characterized by misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the proceedings before the same, as distinguished from indirect contempt, which is committed out of or not in the presence of the court, that tends to belittle, degrade, obstruct, or embarrass the court and justice.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta GUILTY of indirect contempt of court and orders her to pay a FINE of PHP 30,000.00.

Moreover, Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta is found GUILTY of Grossly Undignified Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice. Accordingly, she is ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00, with A STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta, to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and to the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their guidance and information."
"G.R. No. 256116, February 27, 2024","MAIN T. MOHAMMAD, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, MENARDO I. GUEVARRA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, RESPONDENT.","Mohammad was identified as a member of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) responsible for the kidnapping and murder of certain individuals.[6]

In the Resolution[7] dated April 8, 2019, the charges of murder were dismissed as the prosecution was unable to produce a witness who could identify Mohammad as the same person charged in the Information.

On the basis of this acquittal, Mohammad filed a claim for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309 with the Board in Zamboanga City since he was mistakenly identified as a member of the ASG and as a result was ""unjustly arrested, accused, and detained two years for a crime he did not commit.""[8] According to Mohammad, he is entitled to compensation under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309, which provides that ""any person who was unjustly accused, convicted, and imprisoned but subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal"" may file claims for compensation before the Board.[9]

Mohammad argued that the term ""and"" as used in Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309 should not be strictly construed as implying conjunction or union of the words connected by it because doing so would result in grave injustice to Mohammad and other persons similarly situated and would run counter to the very purpose of the law. As laws must be construed in a manner that avoids absurdity or unreasonableness, Mohammad argued that the conjunctive ""and"" should not be taken in its ordinary acceptation but should be construed like the disjunctive ""or"" if the literal interpretation of the law would pervert or obscure the legislative intent. Mohammad surmised that the legislative intent behind Republic Act No. 7309 appears to cover persons unjustly prosecuted even though they have been acquitted by the trial court, as the unjust prosecution ruined their honor and besmirched their reputations. In Mohammad's case, he was arrested, tagged, accused, and identified as a member of a notorious terrorist organization.[10]","This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] filed pursuant to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Rules) by petitioner Main T. Mohammad (Mohammad), assailing the Decision,[2] dated February 1, 2021, issued by the Secretary of Justice (the Secretary). The Secretary affirmed the Decision,[3] dated November 18, 2020, issued by the Department of Justice Board of Claims (the Board), which denied Mohammad's application for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309[4] for lack of prior conviction.","The Petition should be dismissed. The Secretary of Justice did not commit grave abuse of discretion in affirming the Decision of the Board. 
 
Mohammad failed to prove that the Secretary of Justice committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Decision
 

Grave abuse of discretion under Rule 65 has a specific meaning. It is the arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law. For an act to be struck down as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, the abuse of the discretion must be patent and gross.[27]

The Decision of the Secretary finds basis under the clear import of Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309:

Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309 provides as follows:
Sec. 3. Who May File Claims. – The following may file claims for compensation before the Board: 
 
a)
any person who was unjustly accused, convicted, and imprisoned but subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal[.]
The provision is clear. For a successful claim for compensation under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309, the following elements must concur: (a) there must be a person who was unjustly accused; (b) the person must have been convicted of the offense; (c) the person was imprisoned by virtue of the conviction; and (d) the person was subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal. In this case, all elements are absent. Hence, Mohammad's claim for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309 was properly denied.

For the first element, the Court finds that the same is lacking as no other reason was given by Mohammad other than that he was detained for two years only to be acquitted by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) later.[28] The Court reiterates that the finding of probable guilt by our prosecutors, absent any bad faith, cannot be considered as an unjust accusation, even if the same ultimately leads to an acquittal of the accused. The case of Basbacio v. Drilon,[29] is clear in this regard:
Indeed, [s]ec. 3(a) does not refer solely to an unjust conviction as a result of which the accused is unjustly imprisoned, but, in addition, to an unjust accusation. The accused must have been ""unjustly accused,[""] in consequence of which he is unjustly convicted and then imprisoned. It is important to note this because if from its inception the prosecution of the accused has been wrongful, his conviction by the court is, in all probability, also wrongful. Conversely, if the prosecution is not malicious[,] any conviction even though based on less than the required quantum of proof in criminal cases may be erroneous but not necessarily unjust.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

Relative to the first issue, it must be noted for the information of Bayron et al. that the Court's relatively recent Decision in Abella v. Commission on Audit Proper[32] finds application to the instant Petition. In that case, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Butuan City enacted in 2004 an ordinance appropriating extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses for the utilization of certain Butuan City officials, which were actually disapproved by DBM for the 2000 fiscal year due to the prohibition under Republic Act No. 7160 (otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991) against appropriations similar to discretionary funds of the local chief executive but separate therefrom in the LGU's budget. The COA's Regional Office No. XIII in that case also disallowed the disbursements made under said prohibited appropriation on the ground of lack of legal basis, which was eventually sustained by the COA's Proper. In ruling that the COA's disallowance of the illegal disbursements under the Butuan City ordinance was proper, the Court said thus:
Undeniably, [extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses or EME] appropriations and discretionary funds have the same purpose, i.e., to have an available source of funds for certain expenses in relation to the discharge of official functions which are not covered by the regular budget allocation. It is noteworthy that SP Ordinance No. 2557-2004, which was the basis of the disallowed disbursements, already had an appropriation for the Office of the City Mayor's discretionary expenses. Thus, separate amounts appropriated in the local budget ordinance are patent circumventions of the limitation under Section 325(h) of the LGC. To stress, the provision expressly prohibits the appropriation of a separate amount for discretionary purposes other than the two percent (2%) allocated for the local chief executive's discretionary fund.

Furthermore, the COA Regional Director correctly observed that the SP designated its Mayor, Vice Mayor, and SP/Government Department Heads as having equal ranks to those officials entitled to EME under the General Appropriations Acts (GAA[s]) of 2004 to 2009, to wit: Department Secretary, Department Assistant Secretary, and ""Assistant Bureau/Director."" [sic] The SP designations were, however, made without authorization from the DBM, which was a patent contravention of the GAAs. The pertinent GAA provisions are clear that only those officials named in the GAA, the officers of equivalent rank as the DBM authorized, and the offices under them are entitled to claim EME in the amounts provided in the GAAs.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Motion for Reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED. Petitioners Roberto D. Herrera and Mylene J. Atienza are hereby ABSOLVED of any monetary liability relative to the refunding of the amounts covered by the Notices of Disallowance subject of respondent Commission on Audit's Decision No. 2020-100 dated January 16, 2020.

SANDIGANBAYAN AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On June 5, 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman filed with the Sandiganbayan an Information,[3] dated June 5, 2014, for Plunder against Enrile, Jessica Lucila Reyes (Reyes), Janet Lim Napoles (Napoles), Ronald John Lim (Lim), and John Raymund de Asis (de Asis).[4]
The Information reads:

In 2004 to 2010 or thereabout, in the Philippines, and within this Honorable Court's jurisdiction, above-named accused JUAN PONCE ENRILE, then a Philippine Senator, JESSICA LUCILA G. REYES, then Chief of Staff of Senator Enrile's Office, both public officers, committing the offense in relation to their respective offices, conspiring with one another and with JANET LIM NAPOLES, RONALD JOHN LIM, and JOHN RAYMUND DE ASIS, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally amass, accumulate, and/or acquire ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS ([PHP]172,834,500.00) through a combination or series of overt criminal acts, as follows:

(a) by repeatedly receiving from NAPOLES and/or her representatives LIM, DE ASIS, and others, kickbacks or commissions under the following circumstances: before, during and/or after the project identification, NAPOLES gave, and ENRILE and/or REYES received, a percentage of the cost of a project to be funded from ENRILE'S Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), in consideration of ENRILE'S endorsement, directly or through REYES, to the appropriate government agencies, of NAPOLES' non-government organizations which became the recipients and/or target implementors of ENRILE'S PDAF projects, which duly­funded projects turned out to be ghosts or fictitious, thus enabling NAPOLES to misappropriate the PDAF proceeds for her personal gain;

(b) by taking undue advantage, on several occasions, of their official positions, authority, relationships, connections, and influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice, of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.","This is a Petition for Prohibition (Petition),[1] dated March 1, 2022, filed by the petitioner Juan Ponce Enrile (Enrile) praying that the Court enjoin the Sandiganbayan from acting in Criminal Case No. SB-14-CRM-0238, titled People of the Philippines v. Juan Ponce Enrile, et al. (Main Case) and to dismiss the said criminal case.[2]","The Petition is procedurally defective
 
a.
The Petition was filed out of time
 

Enrile does not deny that he filed the Petition only in March 2022 despite the fact that he received the assailed July 12, 2021 Resolution (which denied his Motion for Reconsideration) on July 22, 2021. Enrile insists that because the assailed Resolutions are interlocutory orders, they are not subject to the 60-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for prohibition.

There is no dispute that the Sandiganbayan's denial of Enrile's prayer for: (a) the inclusion of the Bill of Particulars Decision in the Pre-Trial Order; and (b) the Sandiganbayan to limit the prosecution's evidence to pertain only to matters stated in the Bill of Particulars, is interlocutory. An order is interlocutory when it resolves only an incidental matter ""which does not touch on the merits of the case or put an end to the proceedings.""[61] An interlocutory order leaves something more to be done by the trial court as to the merits of the case. Generally, interlocutory orders are not subject to a reglementary period.[62]

However, in San Juan, Jr. v. Cruz,[63] the Court ruled that where there are multiple motions for reconsideration raising the same arguments to assail an interlocutory order, the 60-day period is reckoned from the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration and not that of the last motion for reconsideration. While there is no rule prohibiting the filing of a second (or even subsequent motions for reconsideration) raising the same arguments raised in a first motion for reconsideration, the latter motions can be denied on the ground that they merely reiterate the grounds and arguments already passed upon by the court. Moreover, the reckoning point for the 60-day period is the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration, ""otherwise indefinite delays will ensue.""[64]

The Court applied the ruling in San Juan in Communication and Information Systems Corp. v. Mark Sensing Australia Pty. Ltd.[65] In this case, the Court ruled that the sixty (60)-day reglementary period for the filing of a Rule 65 certiorari petition is reckoned from the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration and not of the third motion for reconsideration. The Court said:
Applying the rule in San Juan, MSAPL's challenge to the order dated April 13, 2009 was clearly time-barred. The 60-day reglementary period for challenging the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment should be counted from April 27, 2009, 39 the date when MSAPL received a copy of the April 13, 2009 Order denying MSAPL's motion for reconsideration of the December 22, 2008 Order which granted CISC's motion to amend the writ of preliminary attachment. The CA, however, considered MSAPL's act of filing a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond as a definitive indication that private respondents have not ""abandoned their right to impugn the evidence submitted in the application for the second writ."" This is erroneous for two reasons: first, MSAPL's motion never impugned the propriety and factual bases of the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment; and second, even if it did, the motion would be considered as a second motion for reconsideration, which could not have stayed the reglementary period within which to file a petition for certiorari assailing an interlocutory order. We emphasize that the provisions on reglementary periods are strictly applied, indispensable is they are to the prevention of needless delays, and are necessary to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial business. The timeliness of filing a petition for certiorari is mandatory and jurisdictional, and should not be trifled with.[66] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Further, in Philippine National Bank v. Intestate Estate of De Guzman,[67] the Court cited San Juan to deny a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, which was filed using the denial of the last of a series of motions to dismiss raising the same arguments as the reckoning point. The Court explained:
The Court finds insufferable petitioner's repeated filing of Motions to Dismiss raising the same ground. In the three previous Motions to Dismiss and in an omnibus motion for reconsideration, petitioner argued that the present case was barred by prior judgment and that there was forum­-shopping. Correspondingly, the issues had been repetitively passed upon and resolved by the court a quo.

The motions were apparently filed for no other reason than to gain time and gamble on a possible change of opinion of the court or the judge sitting on the case. The Motions to Dismiss were filed in a span of five years, the first one having been filed on June 1, 2000 and the last — the subject motion — on February 15, 2005, three years after petitioner filed its answer. In fact, since the first Motion to Dismiss, three judges had already sat on the case and resolved the motions. By filing these motions, petitioner had disrupted the court's deliberation on the merits of the case. This strategy cannot be tolerated as it will entail inevitable delay in the disposition of the case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Prohibition, dated March 1, 2022 is DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 264659, February 27, 2024","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, AS REPRESENTED BY ITS FORMER CHAIRPERSON, MICHAEL G. AGUINALDO, RESPONDENT.","In 2012, the PhilHealth Board of Directors approved Resolution No. 1584, series of 2012. This resolution eliminated PhilHealth's welfare support assistance and concurrently introduced a scheme of benefits for public health workers, including hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance. The Board's basis for granting these benefits rested upon Republic Act No. 7305. In consonance with this directive, PhilHealth RO-NCR and Rizal disbursed hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance to its staff during calendar year 2014. The aggregate sum of these allowances amounted to PHP 43,200,215.08.[9]

In 2015, COA OIC-Supervising Auditor Marissa V. Fajardo-Parinas issued Notice of Disallowance No. NCR 2015-002 COB (14), thereby proscribing the disbursement of hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance to the personnel of PhilHealth RO-NCR and Rizal. The Auditor identified the officials of PhilHealth who sanctioned and endorsed these allowances, as well as the beneficiaries the ·eof, and declared them solidarily liable for the disallowed amount.[10]

PhilHealth filed an appeal to the COA Cluster 6-Corporate Governance Sector, refuting the subject Notice of Disallowance, but this was given short shrift in CGS-6 Decision No. 2015-017.[11]

Consequently, PhilHealth elevated the case to the COA proper via a petition for review. In the assailed Decision, the COA affirmed the subject Notice of Disallowance, noting that PhilHealth personnel are not public health workers entitled to hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laund1y allowance.[12] The COA declared the approving and certifying officers solidarily liable for the disallowed amount. However, the COA spared the passive recipients of liability for being in good faith.[13]

Upon reconsideration, the COA, through the assailed Resolution, partly granted PhilHealth's motion for reconsideration and lifted the disallowance on the payment of laundry allowance. Nevertheless, the COA still affirmed the disallowance of the payment of hazard pay and subsistence allowance amounting to PHP 42,531,290.08.[14]

Undeterred, Philhealth seeks succor before this Court via the instant Petition, imputing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the COA for its failure to consider PhilHealth personnel as public health workers entitled to receive hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance under Republic Act No. 7305, as amended by Republic Act No. 11223[15] or the Universal Health Care Act.[16]

The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) avouched that Phil Health failed to sufficiently establish its personnel's entitlement to hazard pay and subsistence allowance based on the standards set by Sections 21 and 22 of Republic Act No. 7305.[17]","Employees of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), despite being categorized as public health workers, are not automatically eligible for allowances under Republic Act No. 7305 or the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers[1] if they do not meet the requirements of the said law and its implementing rules and regulations.[2]

This Petition for Certiorari (with Application for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction)[3] seeks to nullify and set aside Decision No.2019-294[4] (assailed Decision) and Decision No. 2022-229[5] (assailed Resolution) of the Commission on Audit (COA). In the assailed Decision, the COA affirmed Notice of Disallowance No. NCR 2015-002 COB (14)[6] on the payment of hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance to the officers and employees of the PhilHealth Regional Office for the National Capital Region and Rizal (RO-NCR & Rizal) for calendar year 2014 amounting to PHP 43,200,215.08. However, the COA declared that the passive recipients were in good faith; thus, they need not refund the amounts they received.[7] In the assailed Resolution, the COA partly granted PhilHealth's motion for reconsideration and lifted the disallowance on the payment of laundry allowance. However, the disallowance on the payment of hazard pay and subsistence allowance amounting to PHP 42,531,290.08 was affirmed.[8]","The Petition lacks merit.

A petition under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, questioning the COA's rulings would prosper only when it is shown that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, thus:
A Rule 65 petition is a unique and special rule because it commands limited review of the question raised. As an extraordinary remedy, its purpose is simply to keep the public respondent within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to relieve the petitioner from the public respondent's arbitrary acts. In this review, the Court is confined solely to questions of jurisdiction whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction....

The limitation of the Court's power of review over COA rulings merely complements its nature as an independent constitutional body that is tasked to safeguard the proper use of the government and, ultimately, the people's property by vesting it with power to (i) determine whether the government entities comply with the law and the rules in disbursing public funds; and (ii) disallow legal disbursements of these funds.[18] (Emphasis supplied)
The elucidation of the Court in the case of Puentevella v. Commission on Audit[19] is worth reiterating:
It is primal that factual findings of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise. are afforded great weight by the courts, and in the absence of substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are deemed conclusive and binding upon this Court. In the interest of stability of the governmental structure, they should not be disturbed.[20]
Viewed through this lens, the Court once more upholds its general policy of affirming a decision rendered by an administrative agency, especially one that is constitutionally created, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws that they are entrusted to enforce.[21]

The Court now proceeds to discuss the merits.

The COA correctly disallowed the hazard
pay and subsistence allowance. The COA's
lifting of the disallowance on the payment of
laundry allowance has become final.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The August 8, 2019 Decision and January 24, 2022 COA Decision Nos.2019-294 and 2022-229 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, as follows:

1. The approving officers namely: Atty. Alexander A. Padilla, Recto M. Panti, Ronald M. Vergara, Cheryl W. Peña, and Dennis S. Mas, are held solidarily liable to RETURN the net disallowed amount, which excludes the amounts excused to be returned by the recipients.

Balutan (Balutan), in his capacity as the General Manager of the Philippine Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) essentially averred:

On December 4, 2009, TMA Group of Companies Pty. Ltd. (TMA Australia) and TMA Group Philippines, Inc. (TMA Philippines) (TMA et al.) and PCSO entered into a Contractual Joint Venture Agreement (CJVA) for the establishment of the first thermal coating plant in the Philippines. The thermal coating plant would be for the production of PCSO lotto tickets. PCSO would have no investment in the project except for its commitment to buy its lotto tickets exclusively from the said thermal coating plant.[2]

By Resolution[3] dated August 20, 2010, the PCSO Board of Directors suspended the implementation of the CJVA pending review thereof by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The OGCC eventually opined that the CJVA was void because the purpose for which it was constituted went beyond the primary corporate purpose, mandate, or charter of the PCSO.[4]

TMA et al., thereafter, demanded that the CJVA be implemented, but to no avail. As a result, on April 8, 2011, TMA et al. filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City a Complaint for Specific Performance and Mandatory and Prohibitory Injunction, with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary Injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 11-310. The case was raffled to Branch 39 presided by Judge Winlove M. Dumayas (Judge Dumayas).[5]","Judge Joselito C. Villarosa (Judge Villarosa) is charged with Gross Ignorance of the Law, Grave Abuse of Authority, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Willful Violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct in relation to his dispositions in Civil Case No. 11-310 entitled ""TMA Group of Companies PTY LTD. And TMA Group Philippines, Inc. v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, et. al.""","The Court resolves to adopt and approve the Report and Recommendation dated October 17, 2023 of the Judicial Integrity Board insofar as it found Judge Villarosa liable for gross ignorance of the law, grave abuse of authority, and gross misconduct constituting a violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.

Rule 140[35] of the Rules of Court, Section 14 thereof classifies these infractions as serious charges, thus:

SECTION 14. Serious Charges.—Serious charges include:

(a) Gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct or of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel;

. . . .

(j) Gross ignorance of the law or procedure;

. . . .

(l) Grave abuse of authority, and/or prejudicial conduct that gravely besmirches or taints the reputation of the service;

. . . .

Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure

Indeed, Canon 6 of A.M. No. 03-05-01-SC or the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, requires that judges maintain competence and diligence. Relatedly, Section 3 of the same Canon 6 ordains judges to take reasonable steps to maintain and enhance their knowledge, skills, and personal qualities necessary for the proper performance of judicial duties.

In Department of Justice v. Mislang,[36] the Court emphasized that where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law, viz.:

Where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. A judge is presumed to have acted with regularity and good faith in the performance of judicial functions. But a blatant disregard of the clear and unmistakable provisions of a statute, as well as Supreme Court circulars enjoining their strict compliance, upends this presumption and subjects the magistrate to corresponding administrative sanctions.

For liability to attach for ignorance of the law, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive. Judges are expected to exhibit more than just cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws. They must know the laws and apply them properly in all good faith. Judicial competence requires no less. Thus, unfamiliarity with the rules is a sign of incompetence. Basic rules must be at the palm of his hand. When a judge displays utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he betrays the confidence of the public in the courts. Ignorance of the law is the mainspring of injustice. Judges owe it to the public to be knowledgeable, hence, they are expected to have more than just a modicum of acquaintance with the statutes and procedural rules; they must know them by heart. When the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority. In both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order.[37] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, JUDGE JOSELITO C. VILLAROSA is found GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Misconduct, and Grave Abuse of Authority in violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. JUDGE JOSELITO C. VILLAROSA is FINED in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 payable directly to the Supreme Court within 30 days from receipt of notice. The Court further ORDERS the FORFEITURE of his retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.

Judge Villarosa is required to inform the Court under oath of the specific date when he received this Decision.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be entered in the records of Judge Joselito C. Villarosa."
"G.R. No. 249238, February 27, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. RUBY CUEVAS NG A.K.A. RUBY NG SONO, RESPONDENT.","On December 8, 2004, respondent Ruby Cuevas Ng a.k.a. Ruby Ng Sono (Ng), a Filipino citizen, and Akihiro Sono (Sono), a Japanese national, contracted marriage in Quezon City.[6] Ensuingly, their union bore them a child named Rieka Ng Sono.[7]

Soon after their marriage, the spouses moved to Japan. Unfortunately, their relationship turned sour and they later decided to obtain a divorce. From then on, they secured a ""divorce decree by mutual agreement"" in Japan on August 31, 2007, as evinced in the Divorce Certificate[8] issued by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines. Conformably, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Manila provided an Authentication Certificate[9] and a Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Divorce.[10] Likewise, the City Civil Registry Office of Manila released a Certification[11] dated April 19, 2018, guaranteeing that the Divorce Certificate provided by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines was filed and recorded in its office. So, too, the fact of divorce was duly recorded in the Civil Registry of Japan as exhibited by the original copy of the Family Registry of Japan[12] bearing the official stamp of the Mayor of Nakano-Ku, Tokyo, Japan, and supported by its corresponding English translation.[13]

On May 28, 2018, Ng filed a Petition for judicial recognition of foreign divorce and declaration of capacity to remarry before the RTC.

During the initial hearing, the court a quo admitted all the documentary evidence submitted by Ng for purposes of compliance with jurisdictional requirements. The RTC also allowed her to present her evidence-in-chief ex parte after making a declaration of general default.[14]

On January 3, 2019, the RTC granted the Petition on the thrust of Article 26, paragraph 2 of the Family Code of the Philippines, ratiocinating that there was a valid divorce obtained by Ng abroad, disposing as follows:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment is hereby rendered:

(a)
DECLARING that the petition for judicial recognition of the foreign decree of divorce filed by Ruby Cuevas Ng is hereby judicially recognized by this Court and therefore, as capacitated to remarry under Article 26, 2nd paragraph of the Family Code, in view of the divorce which has been obtained in Japan by her alien spouse, terminating their matrimonial relationship or dissolving their marriage solemnized on December 8, 2004; and


(b)
DIRECTING the Office of the Local Civil [Registrar] of Quezon City and the Philippine Statistics Authority to correct, change name or annotate the record of RUBY CUEVAS NG as regards her civil status to reflect that her marriage with AKIHIRO SONO has already been dissolved by way of foreign judgment and to declare the person of RUBY CUEVAS NG as single and free to remarry.",Repugned in the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] are the Decision[2] of Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (RTC) in SP Proc. Case No. R-QZN-18-05526-SP granting the Petition for Judicial Recognition of Foreign Divorce and Declaration of Capacity to Remarry Under Article 26 of the Family Code[3] and the Order[4] denying the Motion for Reconsideration[5] thereof.,"The Petition is meritorious.

Incipiently, it bears accentuating that Philippine laws do not provide for absolute divorce; hence, our courts cannot grant it.[18] Nevertheless, jurisdiction is conferred on Philippine courts to extend the effect of a foreign divorce decree to a Filipino spouse without undergoing trial to determine the validity of the dissolution of the marriage. ""Article 26 of the Family Code—which addresses foreign marriages or mixed marriages involving a Filipino and a foreigner — allows a Filipino spouse to contract a subsequent marriage in case the divorce is validly obtained abroad by an alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry.""[19] The provision states:

Article 26. All marriages solemnized outside the Philippines in accordance with the laws in force in the country where they were solemnized, and valid there as such, shall also be valid in this country, except those prohibited under Articles 35(1), (4), (5) and (6), 36, 37 and 38.

Where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law. (Emphasis supplied)

The case of Minoru Fujiki v. Marinay[20] elucidates the nature of Article 26, paragraph 2 of the Family Code, thus—

The second paragraph of Article 26 is only a corrective measure to address the anomaly that results from a marriage between a Filipino, whose laws do not allow divorce, and a foreign citizen, whose laws allow divorce. The anomaly consists in the Filipino spouse being tied to the marriage while the foreign spouse is free to marry under the laws of his or her country. The correction is made by extending in the Philippines the effect of the foreign divorce decree, which is already effective in the country where it was rendered.[21]

In the instant case, the Republic opposes the recognition of the foreign divorce decree on the ground that it was by mutual agreement and not obtained through an adversarial proceeding in court and hence, the provision under Article 26(2) of the Family Code finds no application.

The contention is bereft of merit.

In the landmark case of Manalo, the Court emphatically declared that Article 26(2) only requires that there be a divorce validly obtained abroad capacitating the foreigner spouse to remarry, without regard as to who initiated it. Manalo instructs that there must be a confluence of two elements in order for the second paragraph of the quoted provision to be validly applied, to wit: (1) there is a valid marriage that has been celebrated between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner; and (2) a valid divorce is obtained capacitating the parties to remarry regardless of the spouse who initiated the divorce proceedings.[22]

Significantly, the Court clarified that pursuant to the majority ruling in Manalo, Article 26(2) of the Family Code applies to mixed marriages where the divorce decree is: (1) obtained by the foreign spouse; (2) obtained jointly by the Filipino and foreign spouse; and (3) obtained solely by the Filipino spouse.[23]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The January 3, 2019 Decision and the September 6, 2019 Order of Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City in SP Proc. Case No. R-QZN-18-05526-SP are REVERSED. The case is REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings and reception of evidence of the pertinent Japanese law on divorce."
"A.C. No. 13253, February 27, 2024","ELENA S. FELIX AND GEM A. CABREROS, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. LORENZO G. GADON, RESPONDENT.","On June 24, 2021, news of the death of former President Benigno Simeon ""Noynoy"" Aquino III (President Aquino) broke out. Understandably, media outlets started to relay this information to the public as soon as possible. On the same day, Atty. Gadon appeared as a guest host in DWIZ's radio-television show Karambola. During his appearance, Atty. Trixie Cruz-Angeles, a host of Karambola, announced on air the death of the former President. The relevant portions of the episode are transcribed below:

Cruz-Angeles:

The statements made by Atty. Gadon on air caused so much public outrage that the DWIZ management posted a public apology on the DWIZ Twitter page, which reads:

The Management of DWIZ would like to apologize to everyone and in particular, to the Aquino Family about the inappropriate statements made by our guest host in the show Karambola about the sudden death of our former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III.

The Management has taken action about this uncalled for (sic) comments and will not tolerate this kind of incident. We sincerely would like to extend our condolences to the bereaved family and the whole nation.[4]","This is an Administrative Complaint for Disbarment[1] (Administrative Complaint) filed by the Complainants Elena S. Felix (Felix) and Gem A. Cabreros (Cabreros), pursuant to Section 1, Rule 139 of the Rules of Court, against Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon (Atty. Gadon) for his statements made on air on June 24, 2021 and June 27, 2021.","The Court finds that Atty. Gadon has shown himself to be unfit to continue as an officer of the court and a part of the legal profession.

The Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability
At the outset, the Court notes that the Code of Professional Responsibility was revised to address the needs of the ever-changing landscape of the legal profession. On April 11, 2023, the Court unanimously approved the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability[9] (CPRA), which now serves as the standard for ethical conduct for all members of the legal profession. While the subject statements and the filing of this administrative case both preceded the CPRA, the same remains applicable due to the provision expressly providing for retroactive application:

GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 1. Transitory provision. — The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.

Canon II of the CPRA, otherwise known as the Canon on Propriety, finds applicability in this case. The relevant portions of the Canon provide:

SECTION 1. Proper Conduct. — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.

SECTION 2. Dignified Conduct. — A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar.

A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on one's fitness to practice law, nor behave in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession.

SECTION 3. Safe Environment; Avoid All Forms of Abuse or Harassment. — A lawyer shall not create or promote an unsafe or hostile environment, both in private and public settings, whether online, in workplaces, educational or training institutions, or in recreational areas.

To this end, a lawyer shall not commit any form of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic abuse or violence against another person. A lawyer is also prohibited from engaging in any gender-based harassment or discrimination.

SECTION 4. Use of Dignified, Gender-Fair, and Child- and Culturally-Sensitive Language. — A lawyer shall use only dignified, gender-fair, child- and culturally-sensitive language in all personal and professional dealings.

To this end, a lawyer shall not use language which is abusive, intemperate, offensive or otherwise improper, oral or written, and whether made through traditional or electronic means, including all forms or types of mass or social media.

SECTION 5. Observance of Fairness and Obedience. — A lawyer shall, in every personal and professional engagement, insist on the observance of the principles of fairness and obedience to the law. (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, thereby warranting the imposition of the penalty of DISBARMENT from the practice of law. However, in view of his earlier disbarment in In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles, the penalty can no longer be imposed but must nonetheless be recorded in his personal file pursuant to Section 42, Canon VI of the CPRA and should be considered in the event that he applies for judicial clemency. Accordingly, and in view of his prior disbarment, a penalty of FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed instead upon Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's personal record as a member of the Bar; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their information and guidance; and the Department of Justice.

This Decision is immediately executory."
"G.R. No. 226445, February 27, 2024","TUNA PROCESSORS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FRESCOMAR CORPORATION & HAWAII INTERNATIONAL SEAFOODS, INC.,* (HISI), RESPONDENTS.","Kanemitsu Yamaoka owned the rights over the Yamaoka Patent,[6] a process of curing tuna meat using filtered smoke cooled to between 0°C and 5°C. Yamaoka Nippon Corporation (YNC), and later Pescarich Manufacturing Corporation (Pescarich), used the Yamaoka Patent in producing tuna products.[7]

In January 2003, Tuna Processors, Inc. (TPI), a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of California, United States (U.S.) of America, was granted the right to license or sub-license the Yamaoka Patent and its counterparts in other jurisdictions, such as U.S. Patent No. 5,484,619 and Indonesian Patent No. ID0003911. TPI also had the exclusive right to enforce the patents and collect royalties for past and present infringement and damages from third persons.[8]

On March 31, 2004, TPI entered into a license agreement with Frescomar, a company that processes and manufactures seafood products and tasteless filtered smoke in canisters for export abroad.[9] Under the License Agreement, TPI granted Frescomar the non-exclusive license to make, use, import, purchase, sell, or offer to sell products protected by the Yamaoka Patent. In turn, Frescomar has to submit shipment reports as the bases for computing the royalty fees for the use of the patent. If Frescomar believes that any of its products do not use the Yamaoka Patent, it should request for exemption from paying the royalty fees.[10]

Frescomar made an initial payment of USD 3,000.00 to TPI. However, Frescomar failed to make subsequent payments.[11] In a letter dated October 30, 2004, TPI demanded from Frescomar the shipment report and payment of royalty fees.[12] TPI's request remained unheeded.

In another letter dated September 1, 2005, TPI reiterated its previous demands. TPI added that it has come to their attention that Frescomar is producing and selling filtered smoke contained in a canister for William Kowalski (Kowalski) of HISI. TPI demanded that Frescomar submit all information for all transactions, which it believed to be outside the scope of the Yamaoka Patent, and stop using the patent to produce smoke for Kowalski.[13]

HISI likewise sells seafood products in the U.S. and Frescomar's tasteless smoke in a canister to seafood processing facilities outside the Philippines. HISI's products used the tasteless smoke technology protected under U.S. Patent No. 5,972,401 with a corresponding application under Philippine Patent Application No. 1-1998-02560, entitled ""Process for Manufacturing Tasteless Super-Purified Smoke for Treating Seafood to be Frozen and Thawed"" (Kowalski Patent).[14]

In response to TPI's demands, Frescomar initially claimed that the selling of smoke was not covered by the License Agreement.[15] Not long after, Frescomar agreed to pay USD 22,534.80 royalties computed based on Frescomar's shipment reports submitted to TPI.[16] Unfortunately, Frescomar failed to make any payments. TPI sent a final demand letter[17] dated January 13, 2006 asking Frescomar to pay USD 22,534.80 royalties for the past two years. Still, Frescomar failed to comply. Consequently, TPI terminated the License Agreement on January 17, 2006.[18]

On February 13, 2006, Frescomar and HISI filed a Complaint for Unfair Competition and Injunction with Prayer for a Preliminary Injunction against TPI. In turn, TPI filed a Counterclaim demanding the payment of royalties from March 25, 2004 until the termination of the agreement.[19] TPI's Counterclaim raised the issues of whether Frescomar and HISI are liable for breaching the License Agreement and infringing the Yamaoka Patent.[20] Frescomar and HISI filed a Supplemental Reply (To Defendant's Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Opposition to the Application for Preliminary Injunction)[21] and mainly argued that the Yamaoka Patent only covers tuna products and not tasteless smoke technology and that TPI has no right to stop Frescomar from producing the smoke and HISI from buying it.

On August 23, 2007, TPI and Frescomar entered into a Settlement Agreement.[22] In a Joint Motion to Dismiss[23] filed on September 25, 2007, Frescomar moved for the dismissal of its action against TPI, while TPI moved for the dismissal of its counterclaims against Frescomar, both with prejudice.[24] On October 4, 2007, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, General Santos City (RTC) granted the Joint Motion to Dismiss. The dispositive portion states:
WHEREFORE, finding the Joint Motion to Dismiss to be in order, Civil Case No. 7565 is hereby ordered DISMISSED with prejudice. In Civil Case No. 7566, the same is hereby ordered DISMISSED with prejudice with respect to plaintiff [Frescomar] and said case shall continue with respect to plaintiff HISI.","In this case, the Court stresses the importance of examining the patent claims in determining patent infringement. Like the technical description of a real property, patent claims define the extent of protection conferred by the patent and describe the boundary of the invention through words. Any information or invention outside of that boundary forms part of prior art, and the use of that information or invention without the patentee's consent does not constitute patent infringement.[1]

This resolves the consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari,[2] assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) Decision[3] dated September 9, 2015 and Resolution[4] dated August 10, 2016 in CA-G.R. CV No. 02845-MIN.

The core issues are whether (1) Frescomar Corporation's (Frescomar) smoke production infringed Philippine Patent No. 31138, entitled ""Method for Curing Fish and Meat by Extra Low Temperature Smoking,"" or the Yamaoka Patent and (2) Hawaii International Seafoods, Inc. (HISI) is liable for tortious interference.[5]","At the outset, Rule 17, Section 2[55] of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC, May 1, 2020, provides that a complaint may be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance. If the defendant filed a counterclaim before the plaintiff moved for the dismissal, the dismissal shall be limited to the complaint. In this case, HISI moved for the dismissal of the unfair competition case after TPI filed a Counterclaim. Thus, TPI's Counterclaim may still be resolved in the same action. As well, HISI did not question the RTC's order dismissing the unfair competition case and setting the case for hearing TPI's Counterclaim despite receipt of the order.

With regard to the substantive issues, the Court finds that Frescomar did not infringe the Yamaoka Patent when it produced the filtered smoke even after the termination of the License Agreement. The filtered smoke is not an indirect product of the Yamaoka Patent. Besides, TPI already released Frescomar from its liabilities, following the Settlement Agreement and the Joint Motion to Dismiss. Notwithstanding, HISI is liable for tortious interference by inducing Frescomar to violate the terms of the license agreement.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 9, 2015 and Resolution dated August 10, 2016 in CA-G.R. CV No. 02845-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. is ORDERED to pay Tuna Processors, Inc. PHP 1,000,000.00 as temperate damages for tortious interference, PHP 500,000.00 as exemplary damages, and PHP 1,000,000.00 as attorney's fees, which shall all earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 268216, February 26, 2024","ARIDAD PACHECO, PETITIONER, VS. JIMMY F. REYES, RESPONDENT.","The facts of the case as culled from the rollo provides:

Jimmy F. Reyes (respondent) is the lawful possessor of the lot located at No. 39 Visayas Street, Group 3, Area B, Payatas, Quezon City having acquired the same from Benedicto Roquid, by virtue of a Subrogation/Transfer of Rights and Improvement dated February 5, 2004.[4]

Petitioner and her late husband, Ramon Pacheco, Sr., (collectively, spouses Pacheco), as lessees, entered into a contract of lease with respondent at a monthly rental of PHP 6,000.00 to be paid every first day of the month starting on October 1, 2012. Starting April 1, 2017 and onwards, spouses Pacheco failed to pay the monthly rentals, and despite several demands to pay and vacate, no payment was made. Despite receipt of the demand letter dated August 5, 2017[5] and tender of another demand letter dated February 11, 2019, spouses Pacheco continued to remain in possession of the subject premises.[6]

Subsequently, respondent filed a complaint against spouses Pacheco before the Lupon ng Tagapamayapa of Barangay Payatas, Quezon City but they allegedly ignored said complaint and refused to amicably settle the dispute. Thus, a Certificate to File Action dated July 10, 2017 was issued by the Office of Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay Payatas, Quezon City.[7]

On February 13, 2019, respondent, through the University of the Philippines-Office of the Legal Aid's (UP-OLA) Law Intern Juan Paolo M. Artiaga (Artiaga), personally tendered to spouses Pacheco the Demand Letter dated February 11, 2019, demanding them to: (a) pay the respondent the amount of PHP 66,000.00, representing spouses Pacheco's overdue and unpaid rentals; (b) vacate the lot and its improvements, which spouses Pacheco are using as a junk shop. However, spouses Pacheco allegedly refused to receive and sign the aforementioned demand letter despite Artiaga's explanation to them. To prove that Artiaga personally tendered the said demand letter to spouses Pacheco, he executed an Affidavit of Service dated February 22, 2019. Despite such demand to pay and vacate, spouses Pacheco remained in possession of the subject property.[8]

On April 13, 2019, the respondent, through the assistance of UP-OLA, filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer and Damages. Summons upon spouses Pacheco was successfully served to them on April 22, 2019 per the Return of Service of the Court Bailiff.[9]

On May 6, 2019, spouses Pacheco, through Atty. Romeo N. Bartolome (Atty. Bartolome), filed their Answer with Compulsory Counter Claim to the respondent. They denied the allegation of the respondent claiming that the respondent has no cause of action against them because they are the owners of the subject property which they acquired from Acopiado estate, the registered owner of the subject property.[10] They added that respondent is claiming a property different from the one they are occupying. They argued that the respondent has no right to collect any rentals and to claim any damages from them. Spouses Pacheco submitted a Deed of Assignment of Real Property to prove their ownership over the subject property. They further averred that they had not received the alleged demand letter from the respondent. And if ever they refused to receive the alleged letter, they asserted that they have all the reasons to do so as the alleged owners of the subject property.[11]

Spouses Pacheco then prayed that the case be dismissed on the ground of prescription since they have been in open and continuous possession of the subject property for more than 30 years and that the one-year period from the last demand to vacate on August 5, 2017 within which to file the instant action has already lapsed.[12]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Caridad Pacheco (petitioner) assailing the July 26, 2022 Resolution[2] and the May 8, 2023 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. SP No. 173904.","The Court finds no reversible error when the CA dismissed the petition outright for being the wrong remedy and because the petition suffers from several procedural infirmities.

Petitioner averred that her failure to attach a verification and a certificate against forum shopping in the petition she filed with the CA was merely due to inadvertence. She pleaded for liberal application of the rules claiming that her subsequent submissions of the verification and a certification against forum shopping, including all required documents, constituted substantial compliance with the rules.[30]

The Court is not convinced.
 
In Quitalig v. Quitalig,[31] the Court reiterated the following guidelines as well as exceptions with respect to non-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of a defective, verification and certification against forum shopping, viz.: 
1)
A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.


2)
As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.


3)
Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.


4)
As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of ""substantial compliance"" or presence of ""special circumstances or compelling reasons.""


5)
The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.


6)
Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf.[32] (Underlining and italics in the original, citation omitted)
Applying these guidelines here, the dismissal of the CA petition was warranted. A review of the alleged subsequent correction and submission by the petitioner shows that the same was still inadequate. As observed by the CA, the verification and a certificate against forum shopping lack attestation. In addition, petitioner merely submitted the first page of her Position Paper and nothing more.[33] Evidently, the averred subsequent submission made by petitioner is far from substantial.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 259381, February 26, 2024 ","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JONEL F. GEPITULAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In the Information[7] dated July 3, 2018, filed with the RTC and docketed as Criminal Case No. 100-2018-MNK, Jonel was charged with the offense of Illegal Planting and Cultivation of Marijuana Plant defined and penalized under Section 16, Article II of RA 9165. The accusatory portion of the Information states:

That on or about July 2, 2018, in the Municipality of Monkayo, Province of Compostela Valley, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any legal cause and without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly cultivate One (1) marijuana plant a dangerous drug weighing 15.9758 grams when weighed by the PNP Provincial Crime Laboratory Office, Tagum City, Davao del Norte.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] dated November 26, 2020, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02223. The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated December 18, 2018, of Branch 56, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Compostela, Compostela Valley in Criminal Case No. 100-2018-MNK that found accused-appellant Jonel F. Gepitulan[4] (Jonel) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 16,[5] Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165.[6]","In criminal cases, an appeal opens the entire case for review because it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, though unassigned, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors.[69] Simply put, the appeal confers upon the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders it competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, and even increase the penalty.[70]

Essentially, Jonel seeks his acquittal because the corpus delicti of the offense charged was supposedly not proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. His argument is hinged on two grounds: First, he argues that the marijuana plant is inadmissible in evidence because it was confiscated on private land without a search warrant and not during a lawful warrantless arrest. And second, the marijuana plant presented in evidence was not properly authenticated due to the police officers' failure to comply with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.

Jonel’s arrest and the search conducted incidental thereto were valid because he was seen violating RA 9165 in flagrante delicto.
Section 2,[71] Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that every person has a right to be secure in his or her persons. As a rule, therefore, law enforcers must first secure a warrant before they may lawfully arrest a person.[72] Nevertheless, there are several recognized exceptions to the rule, including the situation contemplated in Section 5(a),[73] Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, i.e., the in flagrante delicto exception or when, in the presence of the law enforcers, the person to be arrested executes an overt act indicating that he or she has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime.[74]

When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant, the apprehending officer has both the duty and the right to conduct a warrantless search not only on the person of the suspect, but also in the permissible area within the latter's reach.[75] In such a case, the arresting officer may validly confiscate evidence either on the person of the arrestee or the area of his or her immediate control within which the arrestee might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.[76] Items which may be seized as an incident to a lawful arrest include any money or property found upon the suspect's person that was used in the commission of the crime or was the fruit of the crime, or which may provide the suspect with the means of committing violence or escaping, or which may be used in evidence in the trial of the case.[77] The rationale for the rule is to prevent the suspect from obtaining a weapon to commit violence or to reach for incriminatory evidence and destroy it.[78]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated November 26, 2020, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02223 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant JONEL F.

"G.R. No. 247331, February 26, 2024","HON. LOURDES R. JOSE, IN HER CAPACITY AS CITY TREASURER OF CITY OF CALOOCAN, PETITIONER, VS. TIGERWAY FACILITIES AND RESOURCES, INC., RESPONDENT.","In 2005, Tigerway applied for a renewal of its mayor's permit.[10] The Caloocan City Business Permit and Licensing Office (BPLO) then issued an Order of Payment on January 21, 2005 requiring Tigerway to pay local business tax and fees in the amount of PHP 219,429.80. Following the prompt payment of the assessed amount, a mayor's permit was issued to Tigerway.[11]

Remarkably, it was followed by a Final Demand from the BPLO calling for the payment of deficiency business taxes, fees, and charges amounting to PHP 1,220,720.00. This demand stemmed from an alleged ocular inspection conducted at Tigerway's establishment on May 27, 2005,[12] which purportedly brought to light Tigerway's misrepresentations concerning the nature of its business, the number of its employees, and the size of its business area.[13]

On July 15, 2005, the BPLO issued a Notice of Deficiency reiterating its earlier demand, which was then followed by a Last and Final Demand on December 2, 2005. A further Order of Payment was issued on December 8, 2005, seeking the same amount and citing another ocular inspection of Tigerway's establishment on June 10, 2005 as basis.[14]

A subsequent Order of Payment was issued on December 29, 2005. Notably, the amount claimed was reduced to PHP 500,000.00. Tigerway paid the reduced amount on the same day.[15]

On December 27, 2007, Tigerway filed a written claim for refund or credit to the City Treasurer, asserting that the additional assessments lacked factual and legal basis. Tigerway maintained that its actual liability for business taxes, fees, and charges for the year 2005 should only have been PHP 234,234.79, which is PHP 14,804.99 more than the BPLO's initial assessment.[16] Given its earlier payments of PHP 219,429.80 on May 27, 2005 and PHP 500,000.00 on December 29, 2005, totaling PHP 719,429.80, Tigerway claimed a refund of PHP 485,195.01 (PHP 719,429.80 – PHP 234,234.79).[17]

On the next day, Tigerway filed a Complaint for Refund or Credit of Local Tax and Fees before the RTC under Section 196 of the LGC, seeking a refund of the amount of PHP 485,195.01 which it claimed was erroneously paid to the City Treasurer.[18]

In response, the City Treasurer argued that the Complaint was baseless since Tigerway had lost its right to contest the assessment for having failed to protest it within 60 days from the receipt of the Order of Payment dated December 29, 2009, as prescribed under Section 195 of the LGC. Consequently, with the assessment becoming final and executory, the City Treasurer insisted that Tigerway was precluded from alleging any mistake or error in its payment.[19]

The RTC rendered a Decision in Tigerway's favor, disposing as follows:

WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant complaint is GRANTED. The defendant Treasurer of the City of Caloocan (petitioner herein) is hereby ORDERED to:

A.
Refund or credit to plaintiff (respondent herein) the amount Four Hundred Eighty Five Thousand One Hundred Ninety Five Pesos and 1/100 (Php 485,195.01), plus interest at the legal rate at 6% per annum from the time of payment to defendant on 29 December 2005 until actual refund or credit has been made;


B.
Defendant's counterclaim is DENIED for lack of merit.","Sections 195 and 196 of the Local Government Code (LGC) provide avenues for obtaining refunds of local taxes. Section 195 implicitly allows for refunds as a consequence of a successful protest against a tax assessment, while Section 196 explicitly serves as the dedicated remedy for claims of tax refund or credit.[1] In seeking a refund through Section 195, it is essential that the assessment notice from the local treasurer contains the factual and legal basis of the assessment.[2] Without this, there would be no tax assessment to contest. As a result, the provisions of Section 196 would apply.
This Court resolves the Petition for Review[3] under Rule 45 filed by Lourdes R. Jose, in her capacity as the City Treasurer of Caloocan City (City Treasurer), challenging the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc, which affirmed the Decision[6] and the Resolution[7] of the CTA Third Division. These dispositions upheld the Decision[8] and Resolution[9] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which ordered the refund of the amount of PHP 485,195.01 in favor of Tigerway Facilities and Resources, Inc. (Tigerway).","For the sake of clarity, Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC expressly state:

Section 195. Protest of Assessment. — When the local treasurer or his duly authorized representative finds that correct taxes, fees or charges have not been paid, he shall issue a notice of assessment stating the nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of deficiency, the surcharges, interests and penalties. Within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the notice of assessment, the taxpayer may file a written protest with the local treasurer contesting the assessment; otherwise, the assessment shall become final and executory. The local treasurer shall decide the protest within sixty (60) days from the time of its filing. If the local treasurer finds the protest to be wholly or partly meritorious, he shall issue a notice cancelling wholly or partially the assessment. However, if the local treasurer finds the assessment to be wholly or partly correct, he shall deny the protest wholly or partly with notice to the taxpayer. The taxpayer shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the denial of the protest or from the lapse of the sixty (60)-day period prescribed herein within which to appeal with the court of competent jurisdiction otherwise the assessment becomes conclusive and unappealable.

Section 196. Claim for Refund of Tax Credit. — No case or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax, fee, or charge erroneously or illegally collected until a written claim for refund or credit has been filed with the local treasurer. No case or proceeding shall be entertained in any court after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the payment of such tax, tee, or charge, or from the date the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit.

In this case, petitioner reiterated its argument that respondent could not invoke the remedy under Section 196 of the LGC, alleging that the contentions in the Complaint before the RTC lie with the empirical basis of the assessment, and not with the local government units' (LGUs) power of taxation. Petitioner averred that Section 196 is relevant only when the protest revolves around the taxing authority of the LGU. Thus, the CTA En Banc should have applied Section 195 in this case. It also emphasized that Section 196 is not a substitute for a lost remedy of protest.[43]

Further, petitioner asserted that Section 195 does not require the inclusion of the factual and legal basis of the assessment in the notice of assessment. According to petitioner, the provision merely requires the notice of deficiency to state the details on the nature of taxes, fees, or charges and the amount of deficiency, all of which were sufficiently complied with in the Notice of Deficiency dated July 15, 2005.[44]

Petitioner likewise maintained that respondent's failure to timely protest within 60 days from receipt of the notice rendered the assessment final and immutable and, thus can no longer be modified by any tribunal or court.[45]

The instant Petition is devoid of merit.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The July 25, 2018 Decision and the May 10, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1605 (CTA AC No. 127) are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accordingly, petitioner City Treasurer of the City of Caloocan is ORDERED to refund or credit to respondent Tigerway Facilities and Resources, Inc. the amount of PHP 485,195.01.

For Atty. Gener C. Sansaet's repeated failure to comply with this Court's Resolutions, he is ORDERED to PAY a fine in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 and is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to the records of Atty. Gener S. Sansaet in the Office of the Bar Confidant."

PALMA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY TO THE MAYOR OF QUEZON CITY; AND MARLOWE Y. JACUTIN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS OFFICER-IN-CHARGE OF TASK FORCE COPRISS OF QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The occupants, Cesar A. Altarejos et al. (Altarejos et al.), now petitioners before this Court, had been the actual possessors of the property for around 20 to 30 years.[7]

On October 1, 2013, spouses Edilberto and Dolores Palispis (Spouses Palispis) wrote a letter addressed to Tadeo M. Palma (Palma), the Quezon City mayor's secretary, coursed through Marlowe Y. Jacutin (Jacutin), head of the City Government's Task Force for the Control, Prevention, and Removal of Illegal Structures and Squatting (Task Force), requesting ""the immediate removal of illegal structures and the[] squatters""[8] within the property registered in their names.

Altarejos et al. opposed the request. They stated that Spouses Palispis had previously filed an ejectment case over the property but was eventually dismissed with finality, making any attempt to oust them of their possession without court intervention illegal.[9] In any case, the occupants claimed that the Task Force had no authority to order the demolition of any structure because this authority lies with the building official under the National Building Code of the Philippines.[10]

Meanwhile, the Task Force inspected the site and found several structures ""for residential and others for commercial use""[11] within the property. It held a series of dialogues on three separate dates—October 4, 21, and 29, 2013—with the occupants and the registered owners for an amicable settlement, to no avail.[12]

On November 5, 2013, Jacutin wrote Palma, requesting that the structures be removed in line with Section 3(m) and Section 27 of Republic Act No. 7279.[13] Jacutin emphasized that Spouses Palispis had presented proof of ownership over the property, while the occupants, who had been leasing the space to others, were professional squatters.[14]

In the interim, the Office of the Secretary to the Mayor held more meetings with the occupants, together with the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor and the Commission on Human Rights. Spouses Palispis committed to extend financial assistance of PHP 30,000.00 to each structure owner. For failure to settle, the occupants continued to stay in the property.[15]

On March 17, 2014, Palma issued a Memorandum[16] ordering Jacutin to demolish the structures. It reads:
This refers to the request of Sps. Edilberto and Dolores Palispis dated October 1, 2013, for the demolition or various structures within the lots registered under their names, located at North Diversion Road, Barangay Unang Sigaw, [sic] Quezon City.
 
In the actual site inspection conducted by the Task Force COPRISS, it revealed that indeed there are various structures within the lots of Sps. Palispis being used for commercial and residential purposes.

. . . .

The record will show that the illegal structure-owners did not submit a [sic] conclusive proof or ownership over the lots they presently occupy specifically the duly recognized Certificate of Title under the existing Torrens System or Registration.

. . . .

In the course or the meetings, proofs or ownership and supporting documents or registered-owner [Sps.] Palispis were furnished the occupants through counsel, such [sic] the copy of the Torrens Titles. Tax Declarations, Tax Map, Lot Plan, the Verification Survey Plan submitted by the Department of Building Official, and the masterlist of occupants and structural survey map submitted by the Housing, Community Development and Resettlement Department (HCDRD). They were likewise furnished copies of the Inspection Report of the Quezon City Fire District dated January 17, 2013, finding the structures therein constitutive of a fire hazards [sic], and the Transmittal of the Department or Building Official dated November 25, 2013, declaring all the structures illegal.","Republic Act No. 7279 empowers local chief executives to issue demolition and eviction orders without court intervention, as well as summary eviction, but only on limited grounds. They do not possess unbridled discretion to exercise these powers when the facts of the case fall outside the scope of the law.

This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court holding that the Quezon City mayor has the legal authority to summarily evict the occupants of a property located at 39-C North Diversion Road, Camachile, Balintawak, Quezon City and have their erring structures demolished.[6]","Under Rule 65, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a writ of prohibition is issued to command a person to desist from further proceeding in an action or matter.[53] For it to be issued, the following requisites must concur: (a) it must be directed against a tribunal, corporation, board, or person exercising functions, judicial or ministerial; (b) the tribunal, corporation, board, or person has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion; and (c) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[54]

In City Engineer of Baguio v. Baniqued,[55] this Court clarified that although mayors mainly discharge executive roles, they nevertheless perform quasi-judicial functions, particularly when issuing demolition notices or orders.[56] In Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, Aklan,[57] this Court said:
[I]t is the nature of the act to be performed, rather than of the office, board, or body which performs it, that determines whether or not a particular act is a discharge of judicial or quasi-judicial functions....

It is not essential that the challenged proceedings should be strictly and technically judicial, in the sense in which that word is used when applied to courts of justice, but it is sufficient if they are quasi-judicial. To contrast, a party is said to be exercising a judicial function where he has the power to determine what the law is and what legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties, whereas quasi-judicial function is ""a term which applies to the actions, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies ... required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.[58] (Citations omitted)
Assessing the legality of a structure and deciding whether it warrants demolition entails specific factual inquiries, which require conducting hearings to reach a verdict.[59] In pursuit of these functions, city mayors are bound to exercise quasi-judicial powers.[60] It follows that a petition for prohibition is a proper remedy to command city mayors to desist from implementing their demolition or eviction orders and from further proceeding on the matter when these are issued with grave abuse of discretion.

In this case, the Regional Trial Court, in denying the Petition for Prohibition, simply went to conclude:
At first glance, it must be noted that based on the allegations in the Petition, the petitioners failed to comply with one of the requisites for the issuance of a writ of prohibition – there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Nowhere in the Petition was it alleged that petitioners sought administrative relief before the office of the public respondents. Clearly, petitioners did not seek administrative recourse before filing this action.[61]
We find this hasty conclusion without any basis.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The September 7, 2018 Decision and April 25, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 154278 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 264439, February 26, 2024","RAMON O. SAMPANA, PETITIONER, VS. THE MARITIME TRAINING CENTER OF THE PHILIPPINES, CAPTAIN ALEJANDRO C. AQUINO, JR., AND NORMANDY E. GUALBERTO, RESPONDENTS.","On April 11, 2017, Sampana filed a Complaint[4] for illegal dismissal, regularization, and payment of retirement benefits, 14th month pay, training fees, separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees against respondents The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines (TMTCP), Captain Alejandro C. Aquino, Jr. (Capt. Aquino), TMTCP's chief executive officer (CEO), and Normandy E. Gualberto (Gualberto), TMTCP's administrative and finance manager.[5]

Sampana essentially averred that he was hired by TMTCP as Instructor initially under a consultancy agreement for a period of three months from March 21, 2011 to June 21, 2011 with a monthly salary of PHP 25,000.00. The consultancy agreement was continuously and repeatedly renewed every three months for three years, or from March 21, 2011 to March 20, 2014.[6] Eventually, his contract was changed by TMTCP to one captioned as ""Employment with a Fixed Term"" for a period of three months from March 21, 2014 to June 21, 2014[7] with a monthly gross compensation of PHP 27,000.00. The fixed-term contract was likewise repeatedly renewed[8] every three months until December 21, 2016.[9]

Meantime, on November 8, 2016, per advice of TMTCP's management, he sent a letter[10] to Gualberto inquiring about his retirement benefits. He stated therein that he already turned 60 and has been serving TMTCP for five years and seven months as of October 21, 2016. On November 24, 2016, he sent another letter[11] to Gualberto and Capt. Aquino notifying them that he preferred to retire after his five years and eight months of employment with TMTCP, and reiterating his query about his retirement benefits.[12]

On December 21, 2016, he was allegedly dismissed by TMTCP without just cause. On the following day, he was required to sign an Employee Clearance Form with Release, Waiver and Quitclaim.[13]

TMTCP, on the other hand, countered that it is an educational institution that provides training to Filipino seafarers.[14] Sampana was engaged as its consultant from March 21, 2011 to March 20, 2014 under a consultancy agreement. Sampana requested that his contract be changed from consultancy to contractual basis so it entered into another contract with him. In the new contract, it was stipulated that Sampana's employment was for a fixed period from March 21, 2014 to June 21, 2014. This fixed-term contract was renewed several times. Sampana was fully aware that his employment as instructor was only for the duration of the training course, which is three months, and may be renewed by agreement of the parties.[15]

During the latter part of Sampana's employment, it received several complaints from its trainees regarding Sampana's manner of conducting his classes. Consequently, due to Sampana's unsatisfactory service, it decided not to renew Sampana's last contract after it expired on December 21, 2016. Hence, Sampana was not illegally dismissed.[16]

Too, he was not entitled to retirement pay. While he reached the required age for voluntary retirement, he failed to meet the required five years of service. The period for which he was hired as consultant should be excluded from the computation of the five-year service requirement since no employer-employee relationship existed between them. More, he is not entitled to 14th month pay considering that its grant is a prerogative of management. The grant of cash gift is an act of liberality, not an obligation, which Sampana cannot demand as a matter of right.[17]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158622 entitled Ramon O. Sampana v. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines, Captain Alejandro C. Aquino, Jr., and Normandy E. Gualberto:

Decision[2] dated March 18, 2021 affirming the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioner Ramon O. Sampana (Sampana) did not meet the five-year requirement for optional retirement benefits under the Labor Code; and

Resolution[3] dated October 20, 2022 denying Sampana's Motion for Reconsideration.","
Sampana is a regular employee of TMTCP
The existence of an employer-employee relationship is a pure factual issue which the Court does not generally entertain. The Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases. Hence, the factual findings of the NLRC are generally accorded not only respect but even finality if supported by substantial evidence and especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. But a disharmony between the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, as in this case, opens the door for review by the Court.[39] Here, there is a need to review the records to determine whether the Court of Appeals, in the exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction, erred in affirming that Sampana is not a regular employee of TMTCP, thus:

….

However, with respect to the period from March 21, 2011 up to March 20, 2014, We opine that the same should not be included in the computation since no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties while petitioner was a consultant.

To ascertain the existence of an employer-employee relationship, jurisprudence has invariably adhered to the four-fold test, to wit: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power of dismissal, and (4) the power to control the employee's conduct, or the so-called ""control test."" Verily, the power of the employer to control the work of the employee is considered the most significant determinant of the existence of an employer-employee relationship. This is the so-called ""control test,"" and is premised on whether the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control both the end achieved and the manner and means used to achieve that end.

Based on the Consultancy Agreements entered into between the parties, petitioner was engaged to ""provide consultancy services and coordinate to the Training Director and/or Course Director, for further instructions on his duties and responsibilities and other pertinent related functions."" It is also stated therein that petitioner's consultancy services would be paid in the amount of [PHP] 25,000.00 subject to the deduction of ten percent (10%) creditable withholding tax. Consequently, no income tax was withheld from petitioner. No deductions were likewise made with respect to petitioner's contributions for coverage under PhilHealth, Social Security System (SSS), Pag-Ibig, and other contributions mandated by law to be collected by an employer from the employees.

The consultancy hours agreed upon was from 8:00 o'clock in the morning to 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon from Monday to Friday, and 8:00 o'clock in the morning to 12:00 o'clock noon every Saturday. However, there was no stipulation in the agreement that petitioner was required to physically report at the TMTCP premises from Monday to Saturday. Petitioner likewise failed to present proof that he was actually present at the TMTCP premises for the entirety of the agreed consultancy period.

Petitioner asseverates that he was mandated to familiarize himself with a certain manual, serving as proof that TMTCP exercised control over how petitioner performed his duties. Under the consultancy agreement, said manual refers to nothing more than the TMTCP Company Policies and Regulations. Such document pertains to general matters affecting all stakeholders of TMTCP, i.e., with regard to office decorum and attire. The same does not prescribe the manner or method by which petitioner should conduct the assigned training course. And looking at the complaints, comments, and suggestions of the trainees regarding petitioner and the training course, it is apparent that the manner and method by which petitioner performed his duties are not regulated by TMTCP. Petitioner is given freedom of discretion on how to carry out the training course during the consultancy, petitioner is not even precluded from devoting an hour's worth of lecture time to sharing anecdotes from the Bible.

Under the circumstances, We agree with the findings of the NLRC that the aforecited tests for the existence of employer-employee relationship were not met in this case.[40] (Citations omitted)

CACCAM, RAMIL D. DELOS SANTOS, GABRIEL S. MONTANA, TEOFILO N. BERGANTIN, ARTHUR A. DE GUZMAN, AND CONSOLIDATED BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC., RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from three separate complaints for illegal dismissal filed by the respondents against PPI and CBMI.

PPI is the franchise holder of the Pizza Hut fast food chain in the Philippines, and is represented by its owner, Jorge L. Araneta.[4] On the other hand, CBMI is represented by its President, Salvador S. Ortañez, and Director, Juan Carlo A. Ortañez,* and claims to be a legitimate job contractor which entered into successive service agreements with PPI in order to supply the latter with workers to perform specific tasks.

In the respondents' Consolidated Position Paper,[5] dated December 12, 2013, they claimed that: (1) they were regular employees of PPI by operation of law considering the years of service they have rendered with PPI; (2) their jobs were considered necessary and desirable in the usual business or trade of PPI; (3) they were under the direct control and supervision of PPI's managers; (4) the tools and machines they used were all owned by PPI; and (5) they were directly hired by PPI but were later transferred to CBMI to avoid their regularization under the former.[6]

The respondents further averred that during the pendency of the regularization case they filed against PPI, they were dismissed by the latter without just and valid reasons and without proper observance of due process of law. Hence, they filed a case for illegal dismissal and damages against PPI and CBMI.[7]

For its part, PPI denied having an employer-employee relationship with the respondents. Instead, PPI alleged that the respondents are delivery riders employed by CBMI.[8] PPI further alleged that: (1) CBMI was incorporated and duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission;[9] (2) through the years, CBMI has established its name and goodwill of rendering janitorial, messengerial, sanitation, medical, bussing on tables, kitchen, delivery services, warehousing services, etc.;[10] (3) for more than two (2) decades now, CBMI had been rendering janitorial, bussing, kitchen, cashiering, warehousing and delivery services to PPI, as per the Contract of Services entered into by and between PPI and CBMI, wherein the latter undertook to perform the contracted services according to its own manner and method, free from the control and direction of PPI in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof;[11] (4) the Contract of Services specifically provides for the absence of fiduciary and employer-employee relationship between PPI and CBMI's employees;[12] (5) CBMI hired the respondents who were assigned to PPI as delivery riders.[13] Therefore, PPI argued that it is not the real party-in-interest against whom the respondents may avail of reliefs.

On the other hand, CBMI claimed that: (1) it is registered as a legitimate job contractor with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ;[14] (2) PPI engaged the services of CBMI and contracted out motorized delivery services;[15] (3) throughout their deployment in their respective branch assignments, the respondents regularly received their wages and other benefits from CBMI;[16] (4) it was CBMI that deducted respondents' Social Security System, Philhealth and Pag-IBIG contributions and remitted the same; and (5) during the respondents' deployment, it was also CBMI that approved the former's applications for leave, as well as imposed the disciplinary sanctions for respondents' violation of company rules and regulations; (6) given the foregoing, it cannot be denied that the respondents were employees of CBMI and not PPI.[17]

CBMI argued that it is not liable for illegal dismissal because the respondents were not dismissed but were placed on floating status as a result of the change in circumstance of PPI, which had a reduction in manpower.[18]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Philippine Pizza, Inc. (PPI) assailing the Decision,[2] dated May 23, 2018, and the Resolution,[3] dated November 27, 2018, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 140927. The CA ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) committed grave abuse of discretion, in reversing the Decision of the Labor Arbiter finding that an employer-employee relationship exists between respondents Romeo G. Oladive, Jr., Arnel D. Labog, John Laurence R. Verdida, Paul William S. Soliman, Rommel N. Caccam, Ramil D. Delos Santos, Gabriel S. Montana, Teofilo N. Bergantin, and Arthur A. De Guzman (collectively, respondents) and PPI; that Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI) is engaged in labor-only contracting; and that the respondents were illegally dismissed from their employment.","The Petition has no merit.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that the issue of whether CBMI is an independent contractor, and the matter of respondents' status are questions of fact that are not the proper subjects of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, an exception may be made when the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the CA on the one hand, and the NLRC on the other, are contradictory.[38]

In the present case, the Court finds that the CA did not err in finding that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the Labor Arbiter's ruling that CBMI is a labor-only contractor and thus PPI is the true employer of the respondents.

PPI and CBMI were engaged in labor-
only contracting

As a rule, contracting arrangements for the performance of specific jobs or services under the law and its implementing rules are allowed. However, contracting must be made to a legitimate and independent job contractor since labor rules expressly prohibit labor-only contracting.[39]

Permissible contracting or subcontracting, and labor-only contracting is provided for under Article 106 of the Labor Code:
ARTICLE 106. Contractor or Subcontractor. — Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is ""labor-only"" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. (Emphasis supplied)
Labor-only contracting is prohibited and is not condoned by law as it is seen as a circumvention of labor laws; thus, the labor-only contractor is treated as a mere agent of its principal.[40]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision, dated May 23, 2018, and the Resolution, dated November 27, 2018, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 140927 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. is declared as a labor-only contractor and is adjudged solidarily liable with Philippine Pizza, Inc., the employer of respondents Romeo G. Oladive, Jr., Arnel D. Labog, John Laurence R. Verdida, Paul William S. Soliman, Rommel N. Caccam, Ramil D. Delos Santos, Gabriel S. Montana, Teofilo N. Bergantin, and Arthur A.

Moral damages of PHP 50,000.00;
Exemplary damages of PHP 50,000.00; and
Attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award.

"G.R. No. 255100, February 26, 2024","DOMINGO V. DE GUZMAN III, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","These consolidated cases arose from the shooting of Ferdinand ""Enzo"" Salas Pastor (Enzo) which led to his death.·

The Prosecution's Version

Paolo Salazar (Salazar) testified that he was employed by Enzo as a helper and mechanic. Enzo was an award-winning racecar driver.[4] On June 12, 2014, around 1:00 p.m., he and Enzo left the latter's house in Magallanes and drove to Batangas to retrieve the NASCAR cars Enzo would be using for a race. Enzo drove a yellow truck on which the racing car was loaded, while Salazar sat beside him. They were able to return to Enzo's home around 7:00 p.m. where they were greeted by Dalia, Enzo's wife.[5]

By 9:45 p.m., he and Enzo left the house again and headed to Clark, Pampanga to drop off the car. Again, he took the passenger's seat as Enzo drove with both windows of the truck rolled down. Dalia called Enzo around five times as they made their way to Clark.[6]

The truck came to a stop at the intersection of Visayas Avenue and Congressional Avenue. A man wearing black clothes with a motorcycle mask and helmet suddenly approached the driver's side of the truck and fired at them. Enzo instructed him (Salazar) to lay on the floor.[7] In the midst of the chaos, he was able to see the gunman's nose, eyes, and forehead, and observed that one of his eyes was ""kirat.""[8]

As a result of this encounter, Enzo was shot on his left side. He (Salazar) saw blood oozing out of Enzo's mouth and body. He screamed for help. Minutes later, a UNTV crew arrived but they were brought to separate hospitals.[9] He survived but Enzo did not.

Meantime, on August 23, 2014, around 1:00 p.m., members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) assigned at the District Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (DAID-SOTG) of the Quezon City Police District conducted a buy-bust. operation along Boni Serrano Road, Brgy. Libis, Quezon City. During this operation, the team arrested Police Officer II Edgar Angel y Ybañez (PO2 Angel.).

Bothered by his conscience, PO2 Angel owned up to the killing of Enzo by executing an extrajudicial confession. He said that he came clean because he feared he would be killed next. In his admission, PO2 Angel named Domingo de Guzman Iii alias Sandy (De -Guzman) as the mastermind in the killing of Enzo. Enzo's wife, Dalia conspired with De Guzman and was present when they plotted the killing. PO2 Angel knew De Guzman through the latter's first wife, who was his friend. Around the second week of November 2013, De Guzman called and asked to meet him at Pier One. There, De Guzman engaged him to kill Enzo for PHP 100,000.00. De Guzman told him he pitied Enzo's wife who claimed she was regularly beaten up by Enzo. During that meeting, he and De Guzman did not agree on anything. Thereafter, they met several times, during which, De Guzman tried to convince him to carry out the plan to kill Enzo. During one of those meetings sometime in January 2014, he inquired if De Guzman was having an affair with Enzo's wife, which De Guzman denied.[10]

In the last week of February 2014, he asked for proof that Enzo was hurting his wife. De Guzman showed him a photo of a woman, who was later identified as Dalia, whose face and arm were bruised. De Guzman then handed him PHP 50,000.00 cash as down payment. He next heard from De Guzman sometime in the third week of April when the former sent him a text message, saying ""GAME NA"" and that the motorcycle and gun to be used had been prepared. He (PO2 Angel) responded ""basta text ka na lang."" From then on, De Guzman kept following up with him to carry out the plan.[11]","These Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] assail the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Consolidated Resolution[3] dated January 11, 2021 denying the Partial Motion for Reconsideration of the People of the Philippines, Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Tomas Pastor (Tomas), and Motion for Reconsideration of De Guzman.","No exception exists to warrant
a review of the uniform
factual findings of the trial
court and the appellate court
on the sufficiency of the
evidence against De Guzman
vis-a-vis he issuance of a
warrant of arrest on him and
the denial of his application
for bail

Section 1 of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court ordains that a petition for review on certiorari ""shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth."" The determination of probable cause necessarily entails a review of the facts of the case.[128] It is generally not the function of the Court to analyze or weigh the evidence which have been considered in the proceedings of the lower courts.[129]

Here, there is no denying that the issues of whether probable cause exists to support the issuance of a warrant of arrest on De Guzman and whether strong evidence exists to warrant the denial of his application for bail are both questions of fact which the Court, not being a trier of facts, will not take cognizance of under a Rule 45 petition.[130] More, the factual findings of the trial court on these incidents are valid and binding on the Court especially when the same carry the full concurrence of the appellate court as in this case.[131]

We are nonetheless aware of the exceptions where we may review the factual findings of the courts below:
When the finding are grounded entirety on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (ii) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (iii) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (iv) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (v) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (vi) when in making its findings[,] the Court or Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (vii) when the findings are contrary to that of the trial court; (viii) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (ix) when the facts set forth in the petition[,] as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs[,]. are not  disputed by the respondent; (x) when he findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence. and contradicted by the evidence on record; [or] (xi) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if proper y considered, would justify a different conclusion.[132]
To be sure, however, none of these exceptions exist in the present case as shall be further discussed below. But even if We do a review of the factual findings of both courts below, We ordain that the evidence on record sufficiently support these factual findings.

The evidence against De
Guzman is sufficient to 1)
establish probable cause and
2) deny his application for
bail.

1) On the existence of
probable cause warranting
De Guzman's arrest

Upon the filing of a criminal complaint or Information, the trial court may exercise any of three options under Rule 112, Section 5(a) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure (a) dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly failed to establish probable cause; (b) issue a warrant of arrest if it finds probable cause; or (c) order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five days from notice in case of doubt on the existence of probable cause. No less than the Constitution mandates that issuing a warrant of arrest, should be based on probable cause ""to be determined personally by the Judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.""[133] On this score, the Court has decreed:
Probable cause for the purpose of issuing a warrant of arrest pertains to facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent person to believe that an offense has been committed by the person sought to be arrested. In determining probable cause, the average person weighs facts and circumstances without resorting of the calibration of our technical rules of evidence of which his or her knowledge may be nil. Rather, the person relies on the calculus of common sense of which all reasonable persons have an abundance. Thus, the standard used for issuance of a warrant of arrest is less stringent than that used for establishing the guilt of the accused. So long as the evidence presented shows a prima facie case against the accused, the trial court judge has sufficient round to issue a warrant of arrest against him or her.

If the trial court decides to issue a warrant of arrest, such warrant must have been issued after compliance with the requirement that probable cause be personally determined by the judge. At this stage, the judge is tasked to merely determine the probability, not the certainty, of guilt of the accused. In doing so, the judge need not  conduct a de novo hearing: he or she only needs to personally review the prosecutor's initial determination and see if it is supported by substantial evidence.[134]
In personally determining whether De Guzman, is probably guilty of killing Enzo as a co-principal, the trial court evaluated and gave credence to the following pieces of evidence:","ACCORDINGLY, in G.R. No. 255100, the Petition for Review on Certiorari of Domingo V. De Guzman III is DENIED for lack of merit.

"G.R. No. 230147, February 21, 2024 ","JUANITO GALLANO Y OBRAR, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","That on or about the 11th day of August 2011, at about 8:05 in the evening at the Lotto outlet owned and managed by [private complainant George Arellano (Arellano)] located in Arellano Bldg., Rizal Street, Sorsogon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named [petitioner], did and then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody one (1) fake, false, and counterfeit ONE THOUSAND PESO BILL with serial number LB685736 and with intent to use and knowingly use, as in fact, he knowingly and intentionally use in betting in the forthcoming lotto draw at the said lotto outlet, to the damage of [Arellano] and the Republic of the Philippines.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]

On August 15, 2011, petitioner posted bail for his temporary liberty.[5] When arraigned, petitioner pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges.[6] Thereafter, trial ensued.","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] (CA Decision) dated August 31, 2016, and the Resolution[3] (CA Resolution) dated January 5, 2017, of the Court of Appeals – Manila, Special Sixth Division (CA) in CA-G.R.CR No. 37787. The CA affirmed with modification the conviction of petitioner Juanito Galiano y Obrar (petitioner) for illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, as punished by Article 168 in relation to Article 166 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.","The Petition has merit.

In this Petition, the Court is called upon to stress the concepts of mala in se and mens rea, particularly in relation to the crime of illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, as punished by Article 168 in relation to Article 166 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

Mala in se felonies are crimes which are inherently immoral and such crimes are generally defined and penalized in the Revised Penal Code. However, even if a crime is punished by a special law, when the acts complained of are inherently immoral, they are deemed mala in se.[34]

Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea is a legal maxim which establishes a fundamental aspect of mala in se crimes, namely that ""ordinarily, evil intent must unite with an unlawful act for there to be a crime.""[35] Thus, the existence of a mala in se crime hinges on the concurrence of both actus reus and mens rea.[36] Actus reus pertains to the external or overt acts or omissions included in a crime's definition, while mens rea refers to the accused's guilty state of mind or criminal intent accompanying the actus reus.[37] Hence, the classification of a crime as mala in se hinges not solely on the inherently wrong or depraved nature of the prohibited acts; it also requires that the penalizing law's language explicitly delineates the requisite mental element.[38] Thus, in crimes mala in se, good faith and lack of criminal intent are available defenses.[39]

On the other hand, in mala prohibita crimes, the criminal acts are not inherently immoral but become punishable only because the law says so. With these crimes, the sole issue is whether the law has been violated; criminal intent is not necessary, for the acts are prohibited for reasons of public policy.[40] In mala prohibita crimes, there is no need to prove criminal intent, for the same is conclusively presumed to exist from the commission/omission of an act prohibited by law.[41] To hold the offender guilty or accountable for the offense, it is sufficient that there is a conscious intent to perpetrate the act prohibited by the special law. The essence of mala prohibita is voluntariness in the commission of the act constitutive of the crime.[42]

Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code provides for the crime of illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, while Article 166 of the same code as amended by Republic Act No. 10951,[43] relates to the applicable penalty to be imposed. The provisions read:

Article 166. Forging treasury or bank notes or other documents payable to bearer; Importing, and uttering such false or forged notes and documents. — The forging or falsification of treasury or bank notes or certificates or other obligations and securities payable to bearer and the importation and uttering in connivance with forgers or importers of such false or forged obligations or notes, shall be punished as follows:

1. By reclusion temporal in its minimum period and a fine not to exceed Two million pesos (PHP 2,000,000.00), if the document which has been falsified, counterfeited, or altered is an obligation or security of the Philippines.

The words obligation or security of the Philippines shall mean all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank notes, coupons, Philippine notes, treasury notes, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the Philippines, and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, which have been or may be issued under any act of Congress.

2. By prision mayor in its maximum period and a fine not to exceed One million pesos (PHP 1,000,000.00), if the falsified or altered document is a circulating note issued by any banking association duly authorized by law to issue the same.

3. By prision mayor in its medium period and a fine not to exceed One million pesos (PHP 1,000,000.00), if the falsified or counterfeited document was issued by a foreign government.

4. By prision mayor in its minimum period and a fine not to exceed Four hundred thousand pesos (PHP 400,000.00), when the forged or altered document is a circulating note or bill issued by a foreign bank duly authorized therefor.

. . . .

Article 168. Illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit. — Unless the act be one of those coming under the provisions of any of the preceding articles, any person who shall knowingly use or have in his possession, with intent to use any of the false or falsified instruments referred to in this section, shall suffer the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed in said articles.

A close reading of the provisions shows that there are two ways by which a violation of Article 168 is committed: first, when a person knowingly uses any of the false or falsified instruments; and second, when a person has in his or her possession, with intent to use, a false or falsified instrument. Then, depending on the instrument falsified, the person shall suffer the penalty next lower in degree than what is prescribed in Article 166.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

Let a copy of this Decision be entered into Judge Alzate's record as a member of the bar and notice of the same be served on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and on the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.

The Office of the Bar Confidant is ORDERED to INVESTIGATE Atty. Ma. Saniata Liwliwa G. Alzate, on her alleged participation in the questioned Decisions on the annulment of marriage cases issued by Judge Raphiel F. Alzate.

This Decision is immediately executory.","This Resolution is immediately executory.

SO ORDERED.[4] (Emphasis in the original)
In his recent Manifestation and Compliance[5] dated February 5, 2024, Judge Alzate stated:
THE UNDERSIGNED most respectfully comes before the Honorable Supreme Court and states that:
In compliance with the Resolution of the Honorable Court directing the undersigned to pay the fine in the amount of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS [PHP] 200,000.00 in relation to this case, the undersigned has paid the said amount through the Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC Bangued, Abra;

As proof of payment, the undersigned respectfully submits the certified true copy of Official Receipt No. 5803638 under the SAJ Fund; [and]

The undersigned likewise manifests that he has assumed office as Presiding Judge of Branch 1, RTC Bangued, Abra on February 1, 2024.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed that the Honorable Supreme Court deems this as sufficient compliance of its Resolution dated April 18, 2023.[6]
The thing speaks for itself. Judge Alzate has flagrantly disrespected and defied Our Resolution[7] dated April 18, 2023, pertaining to his five-year suspension, which he is deemed to have only partially served via his previous one-year preventive suspension. He should have commenced serving the rest of his five-year suspension only upon his receipt of the aforesaid Resolution on January 31, 2024.[8]

But what he peremptorily did was to simply pay the imposed fine, and thereupon, take it upon himself to report back to Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra right on the following day February 1, 2024, sans any prior notice or clearance from the Court.

It is, thus, readily suspicious that in his Manifestation and Compliance dated February 5, 2024, he did not even mention the five-year suspension imposed on him. This is a clear signal that Judge Alzate has intentionally omitted the mention of the five-year suspension for no other purpose than to mislead the Court itself and consequently negate its efficacy. This we cannot allow. Neither can we allow Judge Alzate to resume donning the judicial robe as his grave, nay, tainted actions, and omissions invariably depict his unworthiness.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Judge Raphiel F. Alzate GUILTY of grave misconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice for which he is DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all benefits due him, except accrued leave benefits, if any, with prejudice to re employment in any branch of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.

This is immediately executory."
"G.R. No. 262941, February 20, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. YYY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On July 13, 2016, the United States of America (USA) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tracked the electronic mails (emails) of YYY[2] and obtained nude photos of minor girls being sold to online male customers. The FBI traced the coordinates of the emails that led to the northern part of Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines. A male FBI undercover agent had an online chat with YYY who gave him the payment details and access to sexual webcam shows and indecent photos of minor girls. YYY proposed to the undercover agent a sexual meet up and bragged that she offers child pornography to foreigners. On July 27, 2016, the Legal Attache of the US Embassy sent an Unclassified/Law Enforcement Sensitive Letter to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City concerning YYY's illegal activities.[3]

Immediately, the acting chief of the PNP Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division Colonel Villamar Tuliao (Col. Tuliao) directed Police Senior Inspector Mary Gallano (PSI Gallano) to verify the report. PSI Galiano looked for the social media accounts of YYY and learned that she is selling her house in Mabalacat City, Pampanga. On August 6, 2016, PSI Gallano together with Police Senior Inspector Jigs Madato (PSI Madato) conducted a surveillance, proceeded to YYY's house, and posed as buyers. YYY introduced herself as owner of the property and invited PSI Gallano and PSI Madato for a house tour where they saw minor girls, a computer set with webcam, a vibrator, and children's panties. PSI Gallano and PSI Madato took pictures of the premises and confirmed that the room, curtain, and fixtures matched the photos from the FBI.[4]

On August 11, 2016, Col. Tuliao applied for a search warrant before the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Executive Judge Ramon Pamular (Judge Pamular) interviewed Col. Tuliao and PSI Gallano and examined the supporting documents.[5] On even date, Judge Pamular issued a warrant authorizing the law enforcers to searc.h the house of YYY in Mabalacat City, Pampanga for items related to child pornography: (a) computer sets, including a silver monitor encased in a pink casing connected to a black CPU; (b) laptops; (c) modems/routers connected either by cable or connected remotely; (d) computer speakers; (e) other communication/electronic devices connected or remote; (f) telephone sets, cellular/mobile phones, including an iPhone 6 plus; (g) Central Processing Units (CPUs); (h) digital storage devices such as SD cards, thumb drives, and external drives or webcams; (i) memory cards; (j) transaction receipts from money transfer providers such as Western Union, Cebuana Lhuiller, Moneygram, Xoom, and others; (k) sex toys; (1) pornographic pictures and images; (m) birth control pills; (n) lingerie or underwear; (o) condoms and lubricants; (p) cabinets; and (q) black Toyota Vios with a plate number ZLE 632.[6]

On August 16, 2016, at around 6:00 a.m., the police officers and barangay officials proceeded to YYY's house and implemented the search warrant.[7] The operatives composed of Col. Tuliao, PSI Gallano, PSI Madato and evidence custodian Senior Police Officer 1 Edgard Siazon (SPO1 Siazon) retrieved and marked the following items: (a) one computer set (CPU, HP monitor, keyboard, AVR, lampshade, cord, wire, and speaker) marked as ECS ""H"" ECS ""B "" ECS ""G"" ECS ""K"" ECS ""I"" ECS ""L"" ECS ""J"" and ECS ""H,"" respectively; (b) on' e set of wifi modem' marked 'as ECS ""A' ;"" (c) two wallets without money and assorted receipts marked as ECS ""C;"" (d) one set of vibrator marked as ECS ""O;"" (e) assorted receipts marked as ECS ""E;"" (f) Hello Kitty poster marked as ECS ""M;"" (g) one unit of Samsung cellphone, official receipt of a vehicle, two compact discs, empty pills, and checks all marked as ECS ""D;"" and (h) one clear book marked as ECS ""F."" SPO1 Siazon inventoried the confiscated items in the presence of YYY, her live-in partner, and the barangay officials who attested that the search was made in a lawful, peaceful, and orderly manner. The authorities also rescued three minor children, namely, AAA, BBB, and CCC and handed them to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).[8]

On August 22, 2016, the police officers returned the search warrant and presented the seized items to the RTC which, in turn, ordered the PNP Anti­ Cybercrime Division to conduct a digital forensic examination. On September 15, 2016, the operatives interviewed the rescued minors. AAA narrated that she was left under the custody of her aunt YYY after her parents separated. YYY ordered AAA to enter a room, remove her clothes, and stand naked in front of a computer monitor with a webcam where her private parts were exposed to an unidentified old man. YYY likewise took pictures and videos of AAA in two separate occasions where she was made to touch her genitalia in front of a computer screen. YYY gave AAA money and brought her to the mall after each incident. On September 20, 2016, digital forensic examiner Senior Police Officer 2 Jocar Samenian (SPO2 Samenian) extracted from the seized computer set and cellphone the nude photos and videos of AAA who was touching her genitalia and waving at the camera. SPO2 Samenian also obtained a conversation between YYY and a foreign customer about the sale of AAA's nude pictures and videos.[9]","The repeal of a criminal act by its reenactment, even without a saving clause, would not destroy criminal liability.[1] The doctrine obtains chief consideration in this appeal assailing the conviction of the accused-appellant for child pornography with the use of a computer system.","The repeal with reenactment in
Republic Act No. 11930 of similar
prohibited acts in Republic Act No.
9775 does not extinguish the criminal
liability of the accused

As a rule, the explicit, categorical, definite, and absolute repeal of a penal law deprives the courts of their authority to punish an accused charged with a violation of the old law prior to its repeal. The unqualified repeal of a penal law renders legal what had been previously declared as illegal. Differently stated, the offense no longer exists as if the person who committed it never did so.[24] However, the rule is subject to exceptions. One is the inclusion of a saving clause in the repealing law which provides that the repeal shall have no effect on pending actions. Another exception is where the repealing law reenacts the former statute and punishes the act previously penalized under the old law. In such instance, the act committed before the reenactment continues to be an offense in the statute books and pending cases are not affected, regardless of whether the new penalty to be imposed is more favorable to the accused,[25] thus:
Where a clause or provision or a statute for that matter is simultaneously repealed and reenacted, there is no effect, upon the rights and liabilities which have accrued under the original statute, since the reenactment, in effect ""neutralizes"" the repeal and continues the law in force without interruption. The rule applies to penal laws and statutes with penal provisions. Thus, the repeal of a penal law or provision, under which a person is charged with violation thereof and its simultaneous reenactment penalizing the same act done by him under the old law, will neither preclude the accused's prosecution nor deprive the court of its jurisdiction to bear and try his case. As pointed out earlier, the act penalized before the reenactment continues to remain an offense and pending cases are unaffected.[26] (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, YYY allegedly committed the crime charged in August 2016 when the prevailing law is Republic Act No. 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009. On July 30, 2022, the Congress enacted Republic Act No. 11930 or the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act. Notably, Republic Act No. 11930 expressly repealed the entire Republic Act No. 9775[27] but at the same reenacted the unlawful acts defined as child pornography. Republic Act No. 11930 even expanded the scope of prohibited acts and made it a declared policy of the State to protect every child from all forms of abuse or exploitation, whether committed with or without the use of information and communications technology (ICT), such as when the abuse or exploitation involves: (1) performances and materials through online or offline means or a combination of both; and (2) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage or be involved in child sexual abuse or exploitation materials through whatever means. A comparison of the unlawful acts defined in Republic Act No. 9775 and Republic Act No. 11930 does not hint on any intent to decriminalize child pornography:                                   
Section 4 of Republic Act 9775
 	
Section 4 of Republic Act 11930","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals' February 28, 2022 Decision in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 14444 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. Accused-appellant YYY a.k.a. "" xxxxxxxxxxx "" a.k.a.

Provincial Prosecutor[6]

The said Information is based on the Resolution[7] also dated September 4, 2006 of the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Bohol (OPP-Bohol), which is quoted below in full for easy reference:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed to assail both the Decision[2] dated February 22, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated August 28, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) 20th Division in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02697. Said final orders of the CA effectively denied the appeal of Floro Galorio y Gapas (petitioner) from the Decision[4] dated July 28, 2015 of Branch 51, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Carmen, Bohol in Criminal Case No. 0954, and affirmed the same with modifications. The trial court's Decision had convicted petitioner for the crime of Homicide as punished under Article 249 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The instant Petition is very much impressed with merit, and accordingly, petitioner’s acquittal is in order.

Anent the first issue, the Court notes of the various exceptions to the general rule that its disposition of petitions for review on certiorari are limited to errors of law, and concurrently, that the findings of fact below relative to such petitions are deemed conclusive. In Fuentes v. Court of Appeals,[91] the Court enumerated such exceptions to be as follows:

(1) [W]hen the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contradictory;

(2) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;

(3) [W]hen the inference made by the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;

(4) [W]hen there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;

(5) [W]hen the appellate court, in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contradictory to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;

(6) [W]hen the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;

(7) [W]hen the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;

(8) [W]hen the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;

(9) [W]hen the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and

(10) [W]hen the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.[92] (Emphases supplied)

Meanwhile, People v. Esteban[93] also cited the following principle when it comes to the findings of fact by lower courts in criminal cases, viz.:

It is well-settled that, in criminal cases, factual findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight and respect on appeal, especially when such findings are supported by substantial [sic] evidence on record. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, that this Court will re-calibrate and evaluate the findings of the trial court below.[94]

Such recalibration and reevaluation are in order here, for the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the egregious errors of the trial court that seem to have been overlooked by the appellate court here in a disturbingly nonchalant manner. But such shall be discussed later with regard to the third issue, as the Court must first make a short pronouncement on the second issue of whether or not petitioner's right to speedy trial was violated by the trial court below.

The Court in Corpuz v. Sandiganbayan[95] explained the rationale and purpose of the constitutional right to speedy trial, viz.:

The right of the accused to a speedy trial and to a speedy disposition of the case against him was designed to prevent the oppression of the citizen by holding criminal prosecution suspended over him for an indefinite time, and to prevent delays in the administration of justice by mandating the courts to proceed with reasonable dispatch in the trial of criminal cases. Such right to a speedy trial and a speedy disposition of a case is violated only when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays. The inquiry as to whether or not an accused has been denied such right is not susceptible by [sic] precise qualification. The concept of speedy disposition is a relative term and must necessarily be a flexible concept.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 28, 2015 of Branch 51, Regional Trial Court of Carmen, Bohol in Criminal Case No. 0954, as well as the Decision dated February 22, 2019 and the Resolution dated August 28, 2020 of the Court of Appeals 20th Division in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02697, are all REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is thus ACQUITTED on the ground of DEFENSE OF A RELATIVE in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 2 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code, as amended. Petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is also ADJUDGED and DECLARED to be NOT CIVILLY LIABLE to the heirs of the late Andres G. Muring, Sr.

Petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is also ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from confinement if he is still detained, unless he is being held for other lawful case.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. Nos. 244695, 244752 & 245294, February 14, 2024 ","MANGGAGAWA SA KOMUNIKASYON NG PILIPINAS, PETITIONER, VS. PLDT, INC., RESPONDENT.","Petitioner PLDT is a corporation engaged in the telecommunications business. For its operation, it engaged the services of several contractors and sub-contractors to provide services in various areas or phases of its operations. Petitioner MKP, on the other hand, was the exclusive bargaining agent of PLDT's rank-and file employees.[4]

To settle the dispute that arose from the negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement between PLDT and MKP, the intervention of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) was sought, and the parties agreed to have a ""Special Assesment and Visit of Establishment"" (SAVE) conducted in PLDT.[5] Thus, the DOLE issued Administrative Order No. 648 (AO 648),[6] constituting a DOLE Assessment Team that will:
[C]onduct [SAVE] to assess, validate and verify PLDT's, including its contractors/subcontractors, compliance to Department Order 18-A, Series of 2011, on-the-job training and other training-in-employment practices, hiring practices, working arrangements and compliance with general labor standards and occupational safety and health standards.[7]
During the inspection, the DOLE Assessment Team interviewed a total of 1,104 PLDT employees and contracted workers, as well as 37 contractors' representatives from several offices of PLDT in the National Capital Region. The focus of the interview was PLDT's contracting activities and practices.[8]

During a conference held on December 5, 2016, the DOLE Assessment Team presented its Report on the Special Assessment and Visit of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (SAVE Report).[9] In the SAVE Report, the DOLE Assessment Team enumerated their preliminary findings of PLDT's and its contractor's violation of DOLE Department Order No. 18-A, Series of 2011 (DO 18-A).[10] Among other things, the DOLE Assessment Team reported matters that tend to establish that PLDT and its contractors are engaged in labor-only contracting. In particular, the interviews of the workers intimated that PLDT exercised control and supervision over them,[11] which is demonstrated by the following:
a.	
PLDT informed the contractors of its personnel needs, setting the basic requirements for hiring job applicants. PLDT also conducted initial evaluatjon of contractors' job applicants, and those who passed were referred to the contractor for the completion of the hiring process. Contractors' employees also underwent trainings provided by PLDT, either alone or with the contractor.[12]
 	
b.	
Work schedules for contractors' employees and work deadlines were set by PLDT. Rendition of overtime work and availment of leave benefits were subject to PLDT's approval. PLDT also reviewed the work and reports of contractors' workers on a weekly basis.[13]
 	
c.	
Problems encountered by contractors' workers were referred to PLDT's personnel for appropriate action. Most workers interviewed also said that organic PLDT employees supervised them. Special Point of Contact (SPOC) persons assigned by contractors to PLDT only communicated problems encountered by workers but had no authority to address the concerns themselves. PLDT managers or supervisors were always assigned to address work problems.[14]
 	
d.	
Some workers of contractors performed tasks also performed by PLDT employees.[15]
 	
e.	
PLDT possessed the authority to recommend replacement or termination of employment of contractors' workers.[16]
It was also reported that 47 of PLDT's contractors violated general labor standards provisions on overtime pay, holiday pay, service incentive leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and 13th month pay. Nineteen contractors were also found to have made unauthorized deductions for uniform, safety shoes, cable handset, monitoring tablet and other tools.[17]

Based on this finding of control, it was recommended that PLDT should regularize contractual employees performing jobs that are directly related to their business. PLDT was also declared solidarily liable with the contractors to pay the unpaid monetary benefits of the contractors' workers.[18]","Before the Court are consolidated Petitions[1] for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioners Manggagawa sa Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas (MKP), PLDT, Inc. (PLDT), and Silvestre Bello III, in his capacity as then Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment (Sec. Bello), all assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). In the challenged issuances, the CA affirmed, albeit with substantial modifications, the resolutions issued by Sec. Bello in ""In Re: Special Assessment or Visit of the Establishment (SAVE) in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), ""and docketed as OS-LS-0120-0804-2017.","We sustain the assailed Decision of the CA and, thus, dismiss the consolidated Petitions.

The extent of the Court's judicial
review of labor cases vis-á-vis the
scope of the CA 's certiorari review of
the decisions of the Secretary of
Labor and the labor tribunals

To begin with, it must be emphasized that the consolidated petitions before Us are riddled with factual issues that would require the Court to take a second look at the records of the case just to have a complete disposition of this long-drawn controversy. Normally, these factual issues are outside the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which is a mode of appeal that is almost restricted to pure questions of law,[79] save for some exceptions where factual review is allowed, such as when the finding of the lower tribunals are contradictory.[80]

We had recently confirmed this doctrine in Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc. v. Coca-Cola FEMSA Phils., MOP Manufacturing Unit Coordinators and Supervisors Union-All Workers Alliance Trade Unions (CCFP-MMUCSU-AWATU),[81] where We explained:
As early as 1993, the Court has already ruled that ""judicial review by [the Supreme] Court in labor cases does not go so far as to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the labor officer or office based his or its determination but are limited to issues of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion."" This limitation on the scope of review in labor cases is based on the summary nature of labor adjudication proceedings and the nature of the mode of review allowed by law therefrom, Thus, ""[i]n labor cases, petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 [are] limited to determining whether the Court of Appeals was correct in finding the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and jurisdictional errors on the part of the lower tribunal.""[82]
Meanwhile, and as already intimated in the above-quoted ruling, the purview of the CA's certiorari powers over labor disputes are focused on finding whether grave abuse of discretion attended the assailed ruling of the labor tribunal or officer.[83]

No doctrine is more settled than that the sole office of a writ of certiorari is the correction of errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.[84] A court or tribunal is said to have acted with grave abuse of discretion when it capriciously acts or whimsically exercises judgment to be ""equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.""[85] Furthermore, the abuse of discretion must be so flagrant to amount to a refusal to perform a duty or to act as provided by law.[86] In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to labor officers and tribunals when, inter alia, their findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[87] In Barroga v. Quezon Colleges of the North,[88] We held:
In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition.[89]
Based on the foregoing, the scope of the Court's review of the CA's decision involving labor disputes remains confined to questions of law; a unique question of law, at that: did the CA correctly determine whether grave abuse of discretion attended the determination and resolution of the NLRC, or for this matter, the Secretary of Labor?[90] This is best explained in Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corp.,[91] to wit:
We review in this Rule 45 petition the decision of the CA on a Rule 65 petition filed by Montoya with that court. In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case.[92] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Bearing these foregoing principles in mind, We rule that the CA did not err in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of Sec. Bello in issuing his assailed Resolutions. As will be discussed, the CA correctly ruled that the Resolutions of Sec. Bello were not supported by substantial evidence.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petitions in G.R. No. 244695, G.R. No. 244751, and G.R. No. 245294 filed by petitioners Manggagawa sa Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas, PLDT, Inc., and Silvestre H. Bello III (Sec. Bello), respectively, are DISMISSED. The Decision dated July 31, 2018 and Resolution dated February 14, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155563 are AFFIRMED.

The Resolution of Silvestre H. Bello III in OS-LS-0120-0804-2017, issued in his capacity as then Secretary of Labor, is MODIFIED. Sec. Bello's order to regularize the workers of PLDT's service contractors is SET ASIDE, except those performing installation, repair, and maintenance services, who are hereby declared regular employees of PLDT subject to the terms of the REMAND as set out below.

To review and properly determine the effects of the regularization of the workers performing installation, repair, and maintenance services;
 	
(2)	
To review, compute, and properly determine, the monetary award on the labor standards violation, to which petitioner PLDT, Inc., and the concerned contractors are solidarity liable; and

(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he [or she] is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his [or her] case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another . . .

For an arrest effected under Section 5 (a), Rule 113 to be valid, it is required that: (a) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he or she has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and, (b) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.[90]

Bation was caught in flagrante delicto of cultivating plant sources of dangerous drugs when he fertilized and watered the marijuana plants. It is undisputed that the plants he cultivated came out positive for marijuana, a dangerous drug, after laboratory examination.[91]

The warrantless search of the property prior to his arrest was valid. There was no invalid intrusion as the plants were located in an open area visible to passersby. The decision of the police officers to wait out and arrest the person who cultivates the plants, instead of obtaining a search warrant, is a valid course of action. This course of action resulted to Bation being caught in flagrante delicto, leading to his arrest.

Assuming the warrantless search was invalid, Bation cannot argue against the unreasonable search. He is neither the owner nor the occupant of the property where the marijuana plants were discovered, which is around 300 meters away from his house. He admitted that he was not the owner of the property and that a certain ""Bayuyong"" is the owner.[92]

The right to contest the legality of a seizure belongs only to the party whose rights have been impaired.[93] The right is personal, and only a party whose rights were violated can assail the act and move to exclude the evidence gathered pursuant to the act.[94] A person who is not the owner or legal occupant of the place cannot validly give consent to the search therein.

Thus, Bation cannot raise the defense that there was an invalid search of the marijuana plants leading to his arrest.

In any event, the acquittal of Bation is proper due to non-compliance by the police officers with the rule on chain of custody for failure to observe the three-witness requirement.

Bation was charged with Cultivation or Culture of Plants Classified as Dangerous Drugs or are Sources Thereof under Section 16 of Republic Act No. 9165. To successfully prosecute this offense, the prosecution must show that the rule on chain of custody in Section 21 of the same law has been observed. The relevant portions of Section 21, before its amendment,[95] read:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED. The July 20, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01985 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-Appellant Ben G. Bation is ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Director General of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City for immediate implementation. Furthermore, the Director General is DIRECTED to report to this Court the action he has taken within five days from receipt of this Decision.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. No. 256540, February 14, 2024","BISON MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. AAA• AND DALE P. PERNITO,•• RESPONDENTS.","The present petition stems from an amended Complaint[9] dated March 1, 2019 for illegal dismissal and discrimination, non-payment of salary/wages, overtime pay, vacation leave pay, payment of the unexpired portion of the employment contract, attorney's fees, damages, and legal interest filed by respondents AAA and Dale P. Pernito (Pernito) (collectively, respondents) against Bison, Belen M. Al-Humayed[10] (Al-Humayed), and Saraya Al Jazerah Contracting Est.[11] (Saraya).

Bison is the recruitment agency that placed and deployed respondents to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) as overseas Filipino workers (OFW);[12] Al-Humayed is the President of Bison;[13] while Saraya is the foreign recruitment agency of Bison.[14]

The antecedent facts are summarized by the CA as follows:

[AAA] . . . applied with [Bison] sometime in 2017 and, after undergoing the usual screening and interview, was hired as a Cleaning Laborer under a two (2)-year contract with a monthly salary of One Thousand Five Hundred Saudi Riyal (SR 1,500.00). He was deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on 18 October 2017 and commenced work thereafter. In January of 2019 – after working for fifteen (15) months – [AAA] underwent routine medical examination and was found positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). On this basis, his foreign employer terminated the employment of [AAA] because under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an HIV+ individual is considered unfit to work. He was repatriated to the Philippines on 08 February 2019.

As to [Pernito], he applied with [Bison] sometime in 2018 and was hired as a Restaurant Worker under a similar two (2)-year contract with a monthly salary of One Thousand Five Hundred Saudi Riyal (SR 1,500.00). He was deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on 29 March 2018 and commenced work soon thereafter. Unfortunately, after working for around nine (9) months, he was terminated from employment supposedly because he had expressed interest to resign and transfer to another employer. However, [Pernito] vehemently denied this imputation, and claimed that he was actually terminated because his employer saw him and his co-workers conversing with each other during their break time. He was repatriated to the Philippines on 23 January 2019.[15]","Before the Court is the petition for review[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Bison Management Corporation (Bison) assailing the Decision[2] dated November 18, 2020 and Resolution[3] dated May 25, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 164083.

The CA affirmed the Decision[4] dated September 30, 2019 and Resolution[5] dated November 18, 2019 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC (OFW-M)-(L)-08-000564-19. The NLRC had earlier reversed and set aside the Decision[6] dated July 22, 2019 of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. (L) 03-04320-19.","Article XIII, Section 3 of the Constitution provides:

SECTION 3. The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.

It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.

As the Court has succinctly worded in Princess Talent Center Production, Inc. v. Masagca[38] (Princess Talent Center Production), ""[t]he Constitutional guarantee of security of tenure extends to Filipino overseas contract workers. . . . Employees are not stripped of their security of tenure when they move to work in a different jurisdiction.""[39]

"G.R. No. 260118, February 12, 2024","PAOLO MARTIN M. ORTIGAS, DENISE MARIE O. TING AND CARISSA KATRINA O. KO, HEIRS OF JOCELYN M. ORTIGAS, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND HESILITO N. CARREDO, RESPONDENTS.","In their Petition for Annulment of Judgment docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 167025, the Ortigas Heirs, namely Paolo Martin M. Ortigas (Paolo), Denise Marie O. Ting, and Carissa Katrina O. Ko sought to set aside and nullify the Decision dated June 17, 2020 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV (petition for cancellation of a memorandum of encumbrance annotated on TCT No. 004-2017014143 covering a parcel of land acquired by private respondent Carredo through a public auction sale conducted by the City Treasurer of Quezon City for real property tax delinquency of spouses Cicero and Maria Luz Lumauig, the previous owners of the property).[5] They alleged that on October 29, 1999, Spouses Lumauig, for a consideration of PHP 5,000,000.00, mortgaged to their predecessor in interest Jocelyn M. Ortigas (Jocelyn) their property in Quezon City covered by TCT No. N-198628. The parties agreed that in case of default, the mortgagor shall pay 5% compounded interest per month plus 1% penalty per month. On September 1, 2000, the corresponding deed of real estate mortgage was annotated on the title of the property.[6]

Upon the death of Jocelyn, they succeeded to her estate, including all her rights to the subject property. In the course, they came across the deed of real estate mortgage in question and discovered that Spouses Lumauig defaulted in the payment of their mortgage debt. Consequently, they demanded from Spouses Lumauig the total amount of PHP 20,000,000.00 comprising the principal amount plus interest, payable within 10days from notice. Demand letters, the last of which was dated September 19, 2017, were sent by personal service to the address of Spouses Lumauig as indicated in the mortgage agreement. These demand letters, however, were returned unserved because Spouses Lumauig were no longer residing in their given address.[7]

They later on discovered that the mortgaged property was already foreclosed and sold at public auction on July 4, 2013 due to non-payment of real estate taxes.[8] It was sold to Carredo in whose name TCT No. 004-2017014143 was issued.[9]

Thereafter, they filed a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage with the Quezon City Office of the Clerk of Court acting as Ex-Officio Sheriff.

On June 15, 2020, Carredo received a notice of extrajudicial sale of the property covered by TCT No. 004-2017014143. Carredo's counsel claimed to have requested the Quezon City Office of the Clerk of Court for documents pertaining to the said notice. He also allegedly informed the said office of a pending action for cancellation of encumbrance before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City. It turned out that Carredo was referring to the petition entitled Hesilito N. Carredo v. Jocelyn Ortigas and the Register of Deeds for Quezon City, docketed as Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV and filed on September 5, 2018 specifically for cancellation of the real estate mortgage annotated on TCT No. 004-2017014143.[10]

By Decision[11] dated June 17, 2020, Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City granted Carredo's petition for cancellation of encumbrance, thus:

WHEREFORE, the petition for cancellation of the encumbrance or Entry No. PE-5670 annotated on the memorandum of encumbrance of TCT No. 004-2017014143 which is registered under the name of petitioner Hesilito N. Carredo, is hereby GRANTED.

The Register of Deeds of Quezon City is directed to cancel, after proper annotation, the subject encumbrance pursuant to Sec. 108 of P.D. 1529 upon finality or this decision and payment of the necessary fees.","This Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 167025 entitled Paolo Martin M. Ortigas, Denise Marie O. Ting, and Carissa Katrina O. Ko, Heirs of Jocelyn M. Ortigas, v. Hesilito N. Carredo and Hon. Wilfredo L. Maynigo in his capacity as Acting Presiding, Judge of Branch 91, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City:

1)
Resolution[2] dated January 25, 2021, dismissing outright the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by the Heirs of Jocelyn M. Ortigas (Ortigas Heirs) against the dispositions of the trial court in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV for cancellation of encumbrance on Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 004-2017014143;
 	 
2)
Resolution[3] dated October 7, 2021, denying their motion for reconsideration; and
 	 
3)
Resolution[4] dated February 10, 2022, noting without action their Motion for Clarification.","On the procedural aspect, while Rule 45 of the Rules of Court prescribes petitions for review on certiorari as the remedy for errors of law committed by the appellate court, it does not preclude the availment of Rule 65 in cases of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction or denial of due process where Rule 45 does not appear to be a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, as in the present case.

In Tanenglian v. Lorenzo,[29] we held that while a petition for certiorari is dismissible for being the wrong remedy, there are exceptions to this rule: (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. Here, to afford protection to rights of petitioners at the earliest possible time, the petition for certiorari should be allowed to promptly prevent a miscarriage of justice.

The term grave abuse of discretion is well defined in jurisprudence. Grave abuse of discretion means a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment that is patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law.[30] It is a form of limited review that is only confined to errors of jurisdiction.[31] Sarol v. Spouses Diao[32] instructs that a decision rendered in violation of due process, such as one issued despite improper service of summons, suffers a jurisdictional defect.

The Court, therefore, takes cognizance of, and accepts the present petition for certiorari as the proper remedy to nullify the affirmance of the trial court's dispositions which were rendered without jurisdiction and in violation of the constitutional right to due process of the Ortigas Heirs as well as of their predecessor in interest.

We now resolve the case on the merits.

A petition for annulment of judgment is a remedy in equity which courts view with an attitude of reluctance and one that should not be granted indiscriminately by the Court. It is allowed only in exceptional cases as it is an exception to the time honored doctrine of immutability of final judgments. Since it disregards the time-honored rule of immutability of final judgments, the Rules of Court imposes stringent requirements before a litigant may avail of it.[33] On this score, Section 1 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides:

Section 1. Coverage. This Rule shall govern the annulment by the Court of Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions in civil actions of Regional Trial Courts for which the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner.

As worded, since an action for annulment of judgment is only a remedy of last resort, it may not be invoked: (1) where the party has availed himself or herself of the remedy of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedy and lost; or (2) where he or she has failed to avail of those remedies through his or her own fault or negligence.[34]

Further, Section 2 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court provides the specific grounds for annulment of judgment, which are: 1) extrinsic fraud; and 2) lack of jurisdiction, viz.:

Section 2. Grounds for Annulment. The annulment may be based only on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.

Extrinsic fraud shall not be a valid ground if it was availed of, or could have been availed of, in a motion for new trial or petition for relief.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated January 25, 2021, October 7, 2021, and February 10, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 167025 are NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated June 17, 2020 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV is declared VOID.

The Register of Deeds of Quezon City is ordered to immediately cause the re-annotation of the deed of real estate mortgage between Jocelyn Ortigas and Spouses Cicero Lumauig and Maria Luz Lumauig on TCT No. 004-2017014143 or any and all of its derivative titles."
"G.R. No. 255308, February 12, 2024","MA. ANACLETA RACHELLE PAGUIRIGAN Y CUETO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In 2008, Ma. Anacleta Paguirigan (Anacleta) introduced herself to Elizabeth Delos Triños (Elizabeth) as general manager of AJ Construction and Development Company. Anacleta and Elizabeth then executed a contract to sell over a lot situated in Spud St., East Fairview, Quezon City.[4] The agreement expressly stated that Anacleta was representing the vendor and property owner Alfredo A. Rosanna (Alfredo).[5] Thereafter, Elizabeth tendered PHP 100,000.00 as initial payment to Anacleta. However, the transaction did not materialize because Alfredo changed his mind and sold the property to another person. In 2009, Anacleta and Elizabeth executed another contract to sell covering a different lot located at Winston St., East Fairview, Quezon City. Elizabeth paid PHP 780,000.00 to Anacleta. The sale did not push through again when the bank denied Elizabeth's housing loan application. Later, Elizabeth demanded a refund of the sum of PHP 880,000.00 from Anacleta.[6] Anacleta agreed to return the funds and gave checks to Elizabeth.[7] But the checks that Anacleta issued bounced.[8]

On February 26, 2016, Elizabeth charged Anacleta with two counts of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), to wit:
Criminal Case No. 16-03867

That on or about the 14th day of May, 2008, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said Accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud ELIZABETH DELOS TRI[Ñ]OS, represented by Carmelina O. Longakit, in the manner as follows: the said accused, by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations made to herein complainant to the effect that she is a licensed developer and engaged in real estate business and owner/general manager of AJ Const. & Dev't Co., induced and succeeded in inducing said Complaint to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale with an area of 94 square meter located at Spud St. East Fairview, this City, accused knowing fully well that said manifestations and representations were false and fraudulent, and that said representations were made only for her to obtain the amount of P100,000.00, Philippine Currency, and once in possession thereof accused misappropriated, misapplied and converted the same to her own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said Offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9] (Emphasis supplied)

Criminal Case No. 16-03868

That on or about the 30th day of April, 2014, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud ELIZABETH DELOS TRI[N]OS, represented by Carmelina O. Longakit, in the manner as follows: the said accused, by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations made to herein complainant to the effect that she is a licensed developer and engaged in real estate business and owner/general manager of AJ Const. & Dev't Co., induced and succeeded in inducing said Complainant to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale, accused knowing fully well that said manifestations and representations were false and fraudulent, and that said representations were made only for her to obtain the amount of P780,000.00 Philippine Currency, and once in possession thereof accused misappropriated, misapplied and converted the same to her own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said Offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[10] (Emphasis supplied)
Anacleta pleaded not guilty.[11] She claimed that she is the owner of AJ Construction and Development. Anacleta recounted that in 2008, Elizabeth approached her and asked if she could sell to Elizabeth a ""lot with house construction."" Anacleta averred that Elizabeth was fully aware that she was representing property owners in the contracts to sell. Anacleta and Elizabeth had two transactions under this business practice. Anacleta admitted that the first transaction did not materialize because the property owner urgently needed money and sold the lot to another buyer for a higher price. She also claimed that the second transaction likewise failed since Elizabeth was not able to secure a housing loan. Elizabeth allegedly only asked for a refund when her family decided to migrate abroad. Anacleta insisted that she issued checks with the instruction to make a deposit only after notice of sufficiency of funds, yet, Elizabeth deposited the checks without her go signal.[12]

On July 20, 2018,[13] the RTC convicted Anacleta in Criminal Case No. 16-03867, holding that the prosecution proved that she falsely pretended to be the owner of the properly under the first contract to sell, resulting in a PHP 100,000.00 pecuniary damage to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the RTC acquitted Anacleta in Criminal Case No. 16-03868 absent evidence that she falsely claimed ownership of the property subject of the second contract to sell. In both cases, the RTC held Anacleta civilly liable to return the total amount of PHP 780,000.00; thus:
Criminal Case No. 16-03867

In this case, the accused falsely pretended that she [owned] the property she [was] selling located at Spud St., East Fairview, Quezon City... When in truth and in fact, she [did] not own the same. This false representation constituted fraud. It is clear from the testimony of De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os that she parted with her money because she believed that the accused (sic) [owned] the property she [was] selling. Furthermore, there is no question that the element of damage was established. The prosecution was able to prove and duly admitted by accused, that private complainant gave her as initial payment, P100,000.00

. . . .

Criminal Case No. 16-03868

Nonetheless, unlike the first Contract to Sell which did not push through because accused does not own the property, and the owner demanded a higher price, this Court finds that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of Estafa in this case for the second Contract to Sell because in this contract, accused did not claim ownership of the property. Accused therefore is entitled to an acquittal. She is however not entirely free from any liability towards private complainant. It has been held that an acquittal based on reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime charged does not necessarily exempt her from civil liability where a mere preponderance of evidence is required. There is no question that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is preponderant enough to sustain accused'[s] civil liability.

WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 16-03867 accused Ma. Anacleta Paguirigan Rachelle [y] Cueto is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa under Art. 315 par. 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of four months and one day of arresto mayor maximum to two years of prision correccional minimum.

As to the civil indemnity, accused is ordered to return the amount of one hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) to private complainant Elizabeth De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os. Complainant is entitled to an interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.

As for Criminal Case No. 16-03868, for failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused Ma. Anacleta Rachelle Paguirigan [y] Cueto is hereby acquitted of the crime charged. She is however found civilly liable and is ordered to return the amount of six hundred eighty Thousand Pesos (P680,000.00) to private complainant Elizabeth De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os. Complainant is entitled to an interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date or finality of this judgment until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[14] (Emphasis supplied)
Anacleta elevated the case to the Court of Appeals (CA). Anacleta argued that the trial court reversibly erred in convicting her based on facts not stated in the Information.[15] She pointed out that the Information alleged that she misrepresented herself as a legitimate real estate developer, yet, she was convicted of falsely pretending to be the owner of the property under the first contract to sell. In any event, Anacleta maintained that she was not guilty of any deceit since the first contract to sell disclosed the true owner of the property.[16]

On January 24, 2020, the CA affirmed[17] Anacleta's conviction and ruled that Anacleta falsely represented to Elizabeth that she had the power to transfer ownership of the lot.[18] The CA explained that there was no violation of the accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against her because the offense proved was included in the offense charged, to wit:
The foregoing elements of estafa by deceit are present in this case. Ma. Anacleta falsely represented to Elizabeth that she had the power and intent to effect the transfer of the subject lot to private complainant and build a house thereon. Accused-appellant even presented documents to Elizabeth such as floor plans and computations of expenses to convince private complainant to proceed with the house construction. She asked Elizabeth to submit the needed documents for the processing of the housing loan and building permit. As a result of these false misrepresentations, Elizabeth gave P100,000.00 simultaneously with the execution of the first Contract to Sell. She also paid the 30% agreed ""equity"" amounting to P780,000.00.

. . . .

Further highlighting Ma. Anacleta's deceit was her continuous receipt of payments from Elizabeth despite knowledge that she could no longer sell the subject property to private complainant...

. . . .

The fact that the Contract to Sell stated that Ma. Anacleta was representing the vendor, Alfredo A. Rosanna (Alfredo), would not negate a finding of guilt against accused-appellant. Notably, Ma. Anacleta failed to adduce the Special Power of Attorney from Alfredo which could have proved that she has the authority to sell the subject property on behalf of the real owner. As earlier discussed at length, Ma. Anacleta concealed to Elizabeth the uncertainties regarding her authority to sell the subject property.",The integral components of a crime must be sufficiently alleged in the information and established during trial with proof beyond reasonable doubt. The required rule on allegation and proof cannot be restricted to the essential elements of an offense but should extend to the material facts constitutive of the crime.[1] Any doubt in the allegations on the information shall be construed against the State and in favor of the accused who is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.[2] The strict construction is not to enable a guilty person to escape punishment through technicalities but stems rather from the solemn duty of the courts to protect and give life to the constitutional rights of the accused.[3],"The accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them mandates the prosecution to set out in the information every element of the crime.[26] The principal objective of the rule is to avoid surprise on the part of the accused and to afford them the opportunity to suitably prepare their defense.[27] No matter how conclusive and convincing the evidence of guilt may be, the accused cannot be convicted of any crime unless it is clearly charged in the information for which they are tried.[28] The main purpose of an information is to ensure that the accused are formally abreast of the facts and the acts constituting the offense charged.[29] The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is explicit that an information is sufficient if it states ""the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense""[30] in terms sufficient to enable persons of common understanding to know the charge against them and for the court to pronounce judgment.[31] The test is ""whether the crime is described in intelligible terms with such particularity as to apprise the accused, with reasonable certainty, of the offense charged.""[32] The actual recital of facts in the information determines the real nature and character of the criminal charge.[33] The alleged acts constitutive of the offense charged are substantial matters and the right of the accused to question their conviction based on facts not alleged in the information cannot be waived.[34]

In this case, the actual recital of facts in the Information conflicts with the prosecution evidence. It is undisputed that the prosecution charged Anacleta with estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC. What the prosecution alleged as facts constituting the crime charged are that Anacleta pretended to be a ""licensed developer... engaged in real estate business"" and that she ""induced and succeeded in inducing [Elizabeth] to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale.""[35] Yet, the CA and the RTC convicted Anacleta based on the factual findings that she ""falsely pretended that she owns the property she is selling"" and that she misrepresented her ""power and intent to effect the transfer of the subject property.""[36] These factual matters are not in the Information. To convict Anacleta of acts not alleged in the Information while she is concentrating her defense against the narrated facts would be plainly unfair and underhanded. The rule is that a variance between the allegation in the information and proof adduced during trial shall be fatal to the criminal case if it is material and prejudicial to the accused so much so that it affects their substantial rights.[37] Clearly, Anacleta was denied of her constitutional right to be fully apprised of the charge against her, which would have allowed her to suitably prepare a defense. The factual matters not found in the Information, which the prosecution tried to prove, confused Anacleta as to the nature and cause of the accusation against her.

Contrary to the CA's[38] ratiocination, the ""variance doctrine"" is inapplicable. Rule 120, Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court provide the rule in case of conflict between allegation and proof, to wit:
Section 4. Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof. — When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.

Section 5. When an offense includes or is included in another. — An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter. And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter.
Notably, the variance doctrine allows the conviction of the accused for an offense ""which is different from but necessarily included in the crime charged.""[39] For instance, in Sevilla v. People,[40] the Court upheld the conviction of the accused for falsification of public document through reckless imprudence notwithstanding that the charge against him in the information was for the intentional felony of falsification of public document. In Osorio v. People,[41] the Court held that the crime of other deceits is necessarily included in estafa by means of deceit. In People v. Adajar,[42] the Court convicted the accused of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness because it is included in the offense of sexual assault. In People v. Ursua,[43] the accused was convicted of sexual abuse, which was held to be necessarily included in rape by sexual intercourse. In People v. Hong Yen E,[44] the Court ruled that illegal possession is an element of and is necessarily included in illegal sale of dangerous drugs. In Guillergan v. People,[45] the Court declared that falsification of documents committed by public officers who take advantage of their official position necessarily includes the falsification of commercial documents by private persons. The offenses proved in these cases are considered subsumed in the crimes charged. The accused are effectively being held liable for the offenses as precisely charged in the information. Hence, it could not be claimed that there was a violation of the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.

The present case is far different. As intimated earlier, the prosecution accused Anacleta with estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC.[46] Yet, the CA and the RTC did not discuss another offense which is distinct from, but necessarily included in, the crime charged. There is no variance between the offense charged and the crime proved. Instead, the difference pertains to the alleged acts in regard to the proven facts constitutive of the elements of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts. To reiterate, the CA and the RTC held Anacleta liable for the crime charged because of her alleged false pretensions as to the ownership and power to sell the property[47]even if the Information averred the different constitutive act of misrepresenting her engagement in legitimate real estate and construction business.[48] Obviously, there is a tragic gap between the prosecution's theory and evidence, which prompted it to prove facts not alleged in the Information. In this circumstance, the variance doctrine cannot be conveniently invoked to fill the lacuna or cure the weakness and inadequacy of the prosecution evidence. The courts should not allow a rule of procedure to triumph over the constitutional rights of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to be presumed innocent. Without these guarantees, the right to liberty can prove meaningless and due process will only be an empty slogan.[49]

At any rate, the prosecution failed to meet the required moral certainty to sustain the conviction of the accused for the crime charged. The requisites of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC are the following:
(1) The accused used fictitious name or false pretense that he possesses (a) power, (b) influence, (c) qualifications, (d) property, (e) credit, (f) agency, (g) business or (h) imaginary transaction, or other similar deceits;

(2) The accused used such deceitful means prior to or simultaneous with the execution of the fraud;

(3) The offended party relied on such deceitful means to part with his money or property; and

(4) The offended party suffered damage.[50]","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision elated January 24, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 42175 is REVERSED. Petitioner Ma. Anacleta Rachelle Paguirigan y Cueto is ACQUITTED in Criminal Case No. 16-03867 for failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts.

"G.R. No. 244657, February 12, 2024","MICHAEL G. VALENCIA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The Charge

In Criminal Case No. 44965-03, Rubirosa M. Ciocon (Rubirosa) and her alleged paramour, Valencia, were charged with adultery, viz.:[4]
That on or about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of December 2001 and sometime before and thereafter [in] General Santos City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said Rubirosa Ciocon, being then united in wedlock with the Private Complainant Ramon Chito A. Ciocon, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with Michael [A.] Valencia[,] who is not her husband and her co-accused Michael [A.] Valencia, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of her, knowing her to be married.[5]
On arraignment, Valencia pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.[6] Rubirosa remained at large.[7]

Prosecution's Version

Ramon Chito T. Ciocon (Ramon) testified that he married Rubirosa on August 19, 1991,[8] and that he is the father of Emmanuel Job Ciocon, Angelica Ciocon, Dane Ciocon, and Monaby Faith R. Ciocon (Monaby).[9] He was frequently out of the country, working as a 3rd engineer-seaman on a Japanese ship.[10] His wife, Rubirosa, operated a karinderya on Leon Llido Street, Lagao, General Santos City. She introduced Valencia to him as a customer of the karinderya. He later found out that his wife and Valencia were in a relationship.[11]

Every time he called home from abroad, it was his mother who answered the phone. The latter told him that ""there is something wrong with his family"" and that ""he has to go home"".[12] In August 2002, he went home to investigate and see for himself what was happening with his family.[13] It was only when he arrived that he discovered that his family left their house on Leon Llido Street, Countryside Subdivision, General Santos City to reside at Summerlight Subdivision, Polomolok, South Cotabato.[14] Subsequently, his daughter, Monaby, informed him that Rubirosa was living in the same house with Valencia.

He noticed that Rubirosa was uneasy whenever they were together. When he asked her what was going on, she cried and admitted that she was living with Valencia as they were in a relationship. Rubirosa admitted to loving Valencia and eventually left Ramon and his family.[15] Ever since, he no longer knew the whereabouts of Rubirosa.[16]

According to Ramon, the unfaithfulness of Rubirosa ""was very painful"" and ""insulted his manhood.""[17] He filed the case against Rubirosa and Valencia so that they could ""pay for their sins and be imprisoned.""[18]

Monaby identified Valencia in open court and testified that she is the daughter of Rubirosa and Ramon.[19] She observed that Valencia and Rubirosa were always together and that they were ""lovey dovey and sweet,""[20] always hugging and kissing one another.[21]

When she was 8 years old, her family lived in a house at Countryside Subdivision. She and her siblings slept in the living room and noticed that Valencia was on the second floor and did not come down.[22] Out of curiosity, she went up to check on her mother. She opened the unlocked door, and in the illuminated room, she saw Rubirosa and Valencia together in bed, hugging and kissing each other.[23] When Rubirosa saw her, she got angry and shooed her away. After the incident, she chose to keep quiet because she was afraid of her mother.[24]

Monaby testified that Rubirosa and Valencia usually slept together in their house, although she could not tell if they were wearing undergarments, since they were always covered by a blanket. Every time she would see Valencia and her mother, the latter would get angry and tell her to get out of the room.[25]
 
When they moved to the house at Summerlight Subdivision, Monaby said that Rubirosa and Valencia continued to hug and kiss each other.[26] More, she saw Rubirosa and Valencia naked in the bedroom.[27] When she went to get the clothes of her brother, she saw Rubirosa on top of Valencia. As soon as she was able to retrieve her brother's clothes she left out of shock and fear.[28]

She recalled that her father Ramon went to Polomolok, South Cotabato ""to patch things up"" but Rubirosa refused to live with him.[29] Rubirosa then left, and they no longer had any information on her whereabouts.[30]","This Petition[1] assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CR No. 01715 titled People of the Philippines v. Michael Valencia:
Resolution[2] dated October 10, 2018, affirming the conviction of petitioner Michael G. Valencia (Valencia) for adultery under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code; and

Resolution[3] dated January 15, 2019 denying his Motion for Reconsideration.","Preliminarily, we find that the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Valencia's appeal solely on procedural grounds. Rule 42, Section 3 of the Rules of Court clearly states the consequence of noncompliance with the prescribed procedure:
SECTION 3. Effect of failure to comply with requirements. — The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and the contents of and the documents which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.
Although Valencia has shown that the Court of Appeals should have deemed the docket fees paid based on the Certification[67] dated February 8, 2019 issued by the Development Bank of the Philippines, the four other procedural infirmities observed by the Court of Appeals remain unexplained and unrectified. As such, Valencia's perfunctory invocation of ""the interest of justice""[68] cannot prevail against his repeated noncompliance with procedural rules. D.M. Wenceslao and Associates, Inc. v. City of Paranaque[69] is in point:
[P]rocedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have prejudiced a party's substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed.[70]
Further, a petition for review on certiorari is narrowly confined to any of these two grounds: i.e., (a) when the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or (b) when the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.[71]

Absent any of these grounds cited or shown in the petition, there is no special reason to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction here. To stress, the present Petition is a mere reiteration of the arguments already raised and passed upon in full by the MTCC and the RTC, and which were not considered by the Court of Appeals due to Valencia's own procedural lapses. Verily, the Petition should be denied outright.

In any event, whether Valencia committed the adulterous act of engaging in sexual intercourse with a married woman not his wife, as narrated no less by Monaby, Rubirosa's own minor daughter and whether the offended husband has pardoned his unfaithful wife, are both pure questions of fact beyond the cognizance of the Court via Rule 45.[72]

Relatedly, when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, the Court will generally not disturb the trial courts' factual findings.[73] Indeed, trial courts are in a better position to decide the question as it heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial. Here, both the MTCC and RTC found minor Monaby's testimony credible.[74] Valencia has not adduced any convincing reason for the Court to depart from said findings.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED and the assailed Resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated October 10, 2018 and January 15, 2019 in CA G.R. CR No. 01715 are AFFIRMED.

In Criminal Case No. 44965-03, petitioner Michael G. Valencia is CONVICTED of adultery under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to prision correccional in its medium period or imprisonment for two years, four months, and one day to four years, and two months."
" G.R. No. 250296, February 12, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS (DPWH), PETITIONER, VS. A.D. GONZALES, JR. CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from a Complaint for collection of sum of money with damages filed by A.D. Gonzales, Jr. Construction and Trading Company, Inc. (Gonzales Construction) against the DPWH. Gonzales Construction claimed that it entered into two contracts with DPWH for the following: (1) Rehabilitation of Gumain-Porac Division Channel, Sta. 5+800 to Sta. 6+100 in the amount of PHP 2,695,980.00 (Gumain Project); and (2) Abacan River Control Cut-Off Channel along Manggahan Sto. Rosario, Mexico, Pampanga, Sta. 17+500 to Sta. 18+033 in the amount of PHP 8,174,294.32 (Abacan Project).[6]

The Gumain Project was signed by Aurelio Gonzales, Jr. (Gonzales) for the Gonzales Construction and by the District Engineer, Angelita M. Twaño of the Office of the Regional Director of DPWH, and was submitted to the regional director for his signature. On the other hand, the Abacan Project was signed by Gonzales and was submitted to the Regional Director of DPWH for signature.[7]

Gonzales Construction alleged that it performed its undertakings and submitted to the DPWH the corresponding documents to prove the projects' completion. Moreover, the projects were duly inspected and verified as to the work accomplished and were found to be in accordance with the plans and specifications and special provisions of the contracts. Despite completion of the two projects, only PHP 1,178,252.42 was paid representing partial payment for the Abacan Project, leaving an unpaid amount of PHP 9,692,021.92 for the two projects. The last demand for payment was made on March 26, 1999.[8]

Hence, Gonzales Construction filed its Complaint for sum of money before the RTC and to support it, presented the following witnesses: (a) Remedios P. Soto, State Auditor IV of Commission on Audit; (b) Aurelio Gonzales, Jr. (Gonzales), President of Gonzales Construction; (c) Engineer Jesus O. Obordo (Engr. Obordo), then the assistant chief of the Construction Division, Region III, DPWH.[9] It also offered several documentary evidence.[10]

For their defense, DPWH raised special and affirmative defenses: (1) DPWH, being an unincorporated agency of the State, cannot be sued without its consent which the State has not given; (2) the subject contracts were void because no certification was issued that funds had been duly appropriated for the said projects as required by Presidential Decree No. 1445,[11] otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines; (3) the subject contracts were not signed by the Regional Director nor by the DPWH secretary; and (4) the Complaint was premature because Gonzales Construction failed to exhaust administrative remedies.[12] Notably, DPWH did not present any evidence.[13]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated January 31, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated November 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 105103, which denied the appeal filed by petitioner Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The CA, in turn, affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated July 17, 2014, and the Order dated April 1, 2014[5] of Branch 46, Regional Trial Court of San Fernando City, Pampanga (RTC) by deleting the award of attorney's fees and costs of suit; maintaining the award of PHP 5,364,086.35; and adding an interest rate of 6% percent per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.","The petition is denied.

Under Commonwealth Act No. 327,[41] as amended by Section 26 of Presidential Decree No. 1445,[42] it is the COA which has primary jurisdiction over money claims against government agencies and instrumentalities, to wit:
Section 26. General jurisdiction. — The authority and powers of the Commission shall extend to and comprehend all matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and controls, the keeping of the general accounts of the Government, the preservation of vouchers pertaining thereto for a period of ten years, the examination and inspection of the books, records, and papers relating to those accounts; and the audit and settlement of the accounts of all persons respecting funds or property received or held by them in an accountable capacity, as well as the examination, audit, and settlement of all debts and claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities. The said jurisdiction extends to all government-owned or controlled corporations, including their subsidiaries, and other self-governing boards, commissions, or agencies of the Government, and as herein prescribed, including non­-governmental entities subsidized by the government, those funded by donations through the government, those required to pay levies or government share, and those for which the government has put up a counterpart fund or those partly funded by the government. (Emphasis supplied)
It was explained in Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. D.M Consunji, Inc.[43] that the COA has jurisdiction over money claims against a government agency based on quantum meruit.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Court, in the interest of judicial economy, deems it prudent to nevertheless rule on the merits of this case. In addition, it will not serve the ends of justice if the Court will allow this case to go unresolved for an inordinate amount of time.[44] To be sure, this course of action is justified, as may be gleaned from RG Cabrera Corporation, Inc. v. DPWH.[45]

Similar to this case, RG Cabrera Corporation also involved the rehabilitation projects of the government dealing with the aftermath of Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. In that case, the DPWH entered into several contracts of lease of equipment with therein petitioner for the maintenance and restoration of portions of the Porac-Gumain Diversion Channel System. At the end of the lease contract, therein petitioner sought to collect the agreed rentals, but the DPWH did not pay; hence, the former filed several complaints for collection of sum of money before a trial court which was granted, but was reversed by the CA. The Court affirmed the CA ruling considering that it was the COA which has jurisdiction over money claims against the government. Thereafter, RG Cabrera filed the said money claims before the COA but was denied for lack of a prior certification as to the availability of the necessary funds based on Sections 86 and 87 of Presidential Decree No. 1445. The Court reversed the COA and granted the money claims. It held that while the existence of appropriation and the attachment to the contract of the certification showing availability of funds are conditions sine qua non for the execution of government contracts, the absence thereof, however, does not necessarily mean that the contractor is precluded from receiving payment for the services rendered. Citing Quiwa,[46] which the Court found to be on all fours in therein case, the Court held that the lack of certification of availability of funds does not bar a contractor from recovering the fees stipulated in the contract.[47]

Further, the Court explained that the subject lease contracts are not intrinsically illegal, but rather, were merely declared to be so under Presidential Decree No. 1445 for lack of the necessary certification. Nevertheless, it would be an injustice to deny therein petitioner the payment for the use of its heavy equipment, which benefited the public, solely on the ground of the procedural flaws in the contracts.[48]

Applying RG Cabrera Corporation and Quiwa here, Gonzales Construction should be paid what is due to them; otherwise, this would amount to unjust enrichment to the State at the expense of Gonzales Construction, which this Court cannot countenance.

The DPWH, however, argues that Gonzales Construction failed to present convincing evidence that it had accomplished 90.61 % of the Abacan Project to be entitled for payment.

It must be stressed that a review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing questions of law, subject to this Court's discretion and other exceptions recognized in case law.[49] The Court finds that these reasons are not present in this case to review the uniform findings of fact of the RTC and the CA. As a general rule, the factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the appellate court, attain conclusiveness and are given utmost respect by this Court.[50] Here, the RTC found that 90.61% of the Abacan Project was accomplished and the value of the completed works evaluated in the amount of PHP 7,332,292.45. The CA affirmed that 90.61% of the Abacan Project was accomplished after evaluating on its own the pieces of evidence submitted by Gonzales Construction, while DPWH did not present evidence to the contrary. Hence, this Court will not disturb the factual findings of the RTC and the CA.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 228490, February 12, 2024 ","HEIRS OF ELIAS SOLANO & GLECERIA FALABI SOLANO, PETITIONERS, VS. PASCUAL T. DY, RESPONDENT.","Elias Solano (Elias) owned two parcels of land—Lot 1-A-32 with an area of 7,351 square meters (sqm), and Lot 1-A-25 consisting of 2,284 sqm, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 230[8] and 232,[9] respectively. The properties are situated at Barrio Triangulo, Naga City, Camarines Sur and were acquired by Elias as a farmer beneficiary, under Emancipation Patent Nos. A-109074 and A-109076.

Sometime in December 1999, spouses Solano obtained a PHP 100,000.00 loan, payable within three months, from spouses Samson. As a condition for the release of the proceeds, Elias executed a Special Power of Attorney[10] (SPA) dated December 3, 1999 in favor of Merle Samson (Merle) over Lot 1-A-32. Elias's wife Gleceria Solano (Gleceria) gave her marital consent and signed the SPA. In addition, spouses Solano executed a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999. When spouses Solano failed to pay the loan within the stipulated period, they got another PHP 150,000.00 loan and surrendered the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 230 to Merle.

A few months later, spouses Solano sold Lot 1-A-25 to spouses Samson for PHP 100,000.00 as shown in the Deed of Absolute Sale[11] dated April 6, 2000.

On April 15, 2000, by virtue of the SPA dated December 3, 1999 granted to her by Elias, Merle sold Lot 1-A-32 to Pascual Dy (Dy) in the amount of PHP 500,000.00 through a Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase.[12]

Subsequently, on December 20, 2001, Merle also sold Lot 1-A-25 to Dy for the amount of PHP 500,000.00 via a Deed of Absolute Sale.[13] Merle gave the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 232 to Dy without effecting the registration of the previous sale of Lot 1-A-25 between her and spouses Solano.[14]

Several years later, on January 3, 2008, Dy filed Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, which is a Complaint[15] for specific performance against spouses Samson and spouses Solano with the RTC of Naga City, Branch 22 (RTC-Branch 22). Dy claimed that he failed to have the deeds of conveyance for the two properties notarized and registered because he misplaced the following documents: (1) the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 230 for Lot 1-A-32; (2) the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated April 15, 2000 for Lot 1-A-32; and (3) the Special Power of Attorney dated December 3, 1999 for Lot 1-A-32.[16] The delay in the registration was compounded by the failure of spouses Samson and spouses Solano to raise the funds to repurchase Lot 1-A-32. When he found the missing documents, Dy decided to transfer the titles of the lots in his name. However, both spouses refused to sign new notarized deeds of sale in his favor. Dy thus prayed that defendants-spouses be ordered to execute deeds of conveyance to allow him to register Lot 1-A-32 and Lot 1-A-25 in his name.[17]

In their Answer with Counterclaim,[18] spouses Solano countered that they did not intend to sell their properties to spouses Samson. They obtained loans from spouses Samson but clarified that the documents were solely prepared by Merle. Spouses Solano did not understand the contents of the documents which were written in English given that Gleceria only reached Grade 3 and Elias was a Grade 6 dropout. They were in dire need of money and Merle Samson tricked them into signing the following: (1) SPA dated December 3, 1999 for Lot 1-A-32; (2) Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999 for Lot 1-A-32; and (3) Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 6, 2000 for Lot 1-A-25. Spouses Solano stressed that they are still in actual possession of the lots in the concept of owners, and spouses Samson never attempted to register the same under their names. Spouses Solano tried to settle their loan obligation in the amount of PHP 300,000.00, but Merle refused to accept the payment. Consequently, spouses Solano instituted Civil Case No. 2003-0150, which is an action for ""Revocation and Cancellation of the Deeds of Sale and SPA""[19] with damages against spouses Samson before the RTC of Naga City, Branch 21 (RTC-Branch 21). During the trial, Merle did not disclose that she already sold the properties to Dy. It was only in the execution stage that Merle admitted that the TCTs could not be returned to spouses Solano because she gave the titles to Dy on account of the subsequent sale.[20]

As special affirmative defense, spouses Solano stated that Dy has no cause of action against them. They were not privy to the transactions between Dy and spouses Samson involving the two properties. They maintained that the subsequent sales were not registered nor annotated in the certificates of title. In addition, spouses Solano maintained that the deeds of sale they supposedly executed in favor of Merle are actually equitable mortgages. For this reason, Merle could not validly use the documents they signed to sell the properties to Dy. As counterclaim, spouses Solano prayed for the award of PHP 100,000.00 for moral damages, PHP 50,000.00 for exemplary damages, PHP 50,000.00 for attorney's fees, PHP 1,500.00 for each court appearance, and PHP 20,000.00 for litigation expenses.[21]

In his Reply,[22] Dy argued that spouses Solano could not deny the authority they gave to spouses Samson to sell and mortgage the lots. Dy pointed out that even in Civil Case No. 2003-0150, the trial court rejected spouses Solano's prayer for revocation or nullification of the SPA for Lot 1-A-32 in view of their admission that they voluntarily signed the documents when they obtained the loan.[23]","No person shall be affected by a proceeding in which he is a stranger.[1] We observe this jurisprudential dictum in resolving the present appeals.
The Case

Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari: G.R. No. 228490[2] filed by the heirs of spouses Elias and Gleceria Solano and G.R. No. 228645[3] filed by the heirs of Pascual T. Dy, both questioning the Decision[4] dated April 8, 2016 and Resolution[5] dated November 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 103451, which modified the Decision[6] dated June 17, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Naga City, Branch 22 in Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, involving a Complaint[7] for specific performance filed by Pascual T. Dy (Dy) against spouses Renato and Merle Samson (spouses Samson) and spouses Elias and Gleceria Solano (spouses Solano).","The Court partially grants G.R. No. 228490 and G.R. No. 228645.

To serve as a goalpost, we state at the outset that the Decision dated February 2, 2007 of the RTC-Branch 21 in Civil Case No. 2003-0150 is final and executory. Inevitably, the RTC's declaration that the transactions between the Solanos and the Samsons are equitable mortgages may no longer be altered following the doctrine of immutability of final judgment.

Relying on RTC-Branch 21's final Decision, the Solanos now invoke the principle of res judicata in arguing that the heirs of Dy can no longer assert any claim over the properties that are the subject of the equitable mortgages.

There are two concepts of res judicata. The first kind is res judicata through bar by prior judgment[53] wherein there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In the second one which is res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment,[54] there is only identity of parties and subject matter or issues. Considering that there is no identity of causes of action in res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, the final ruling is conclusive only as to those matters directly controverted and determined in the first case.[55]

Consequently, there is res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment when the following elements are present: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be identity of parties and issues as between the first and second action, but not identity of causes of action.[56]

There is no question that the first, second, and third elements are present in this case. First, the RTC-Branch 21 decision is final and executory there being no appeal taken within the reglementary period. Second, the RTC had jurisdiction over the case, the subject matter, and the parties. Third, the RTC's judgment was rendered based on the merits.

Our task then is to determine the existence of the fourth element, which is the identity of parties and issues.

With regard to the similarity of parties, the Court explained in PD No. 1271 Committee v. De Guzman[57] that the parties in the two cases need not be identical provided that they substantially share the same interest. It is enough that there is privity between the party in the first case and in the second case, like when a successor-in-interest or an heir participates in the second case.[58]

There is identity of parties in the present controversy. In the first case decided by RTC-Branch 21, spouses Solano were the plaintiffs while spouses Samson were the defendants. In the second case decided by RTC-Branch 22, Dy was the plaintiff while spouses Solano and spouses Samson were impleaded as co-defendants. Although the parties are not strictly identical, there is substantial identity. Substantial identity of parties exists when there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case.[59] As stressed in Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals[60] and Republic v. Court of Appeals,[61] absolute identity is not required:

For purposes of res judicata, only substantial identity is required and not absolute identity. Parties in both cases need not be physically identical provided that there is privity between the parties or their successors-in-interest subsequent to the commencement of the previous cause of action, litigating for the same thing, title[,] or capacity.[62] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the petition in G.R. No. 228490 filed by the heirs of spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano and the petition in G.R. No. 228645 filed by the heirs of Pascual T. Dy are PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated April 8, 2016 and Resolution dated November 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103451, which modified the Decision dated June 17, 2014 of Branch 22, Regional Trial Court of Naga City in Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, are REVERSED.

As discussed above, the final judgment of Branch 21, Regional Trial Court of Naga City in Civil Case No. 2003-0150, which declared the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999 and the Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 6, 2000 between spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano and spouses Renato and Merle Samson, as equitable mortgages STANDS. The Court further decrees that:

(1) Spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano/heirs are entitled to repurchase the mortgaged properties described as Lot 1-A-32 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 230, and Lot No. 1-A-25 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 232. For this purpose, they are ORDERED to pay the principal mortgaged debt to Pascual Dy/heirs, in the total amount of PHP 300,000.00, with interest at the legal rate of 12% per annum, from January 15, 2009 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.

"G.R. No. 257702, February 07, 2024","MARK ANTHONY PAGTAKHAN Y FLORES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The Information[5] against petitioner alleged the following:

Contrary to law.

December 11, 2017, Pasay City, Metro Manila.[6] (Italics in the original)

The said Information is based on the Resolution[7] of even date of the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Pasay City, which is as follows:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] that assails both the Decision[2] dated November 10, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated October 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 43208. Said rulings of the CA affirmed the Decision[4] dated March 13, 2019 of Branch 108, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City in Criminal Case No. R-PSY-18-15642-CR, which convicted Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores (petitioner) of the crime of robbery as penalized under Article 293, in relation to Article 294, Paragraph 5 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code.","The instant Petition is impressed with merit, and accordingly, petitioner is entitled to an acquittal.

Preliminarily, the Court is mindful of various exceptions to the general rule that petitions for review on certiorari are properly limited to the Court's review of errors of law, and indeed, the findings of fact of trial and appellate courts below relative to the antecedents of such petitions are deemed conclusive. The Court enumerated the said exceptions in Fuentes v. Court of Appeals,[29] viz.:

(1) [W]hen the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contradictory;

(2) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;

(3) [W]hen the inference made by the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;

(4) [W]hen there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;

(5) [W]hen the appellate court, in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contradictory to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;

(6) [W]hen the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;

(7) [W]hen the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;

(8) [W]hen the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;

(9) [W]hen the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and

(10) [W]hen the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.[30] (Emphases supplied)

Moreover, the Court reiterated in Macayan, Jr. v. People[31] the aforementioned enumeration, which also cited the admonition in People v. Esteban[32] when it comes to reviewing findings of fact in criminal cases, to wit:

It is well-settled that, in criminal cases, factual findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight and respect on appeal, especially when such findings are supported by substantial [sic] evidence on record. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, that this Court will re-calibrate and evaluate the findings of the trial court below.[33]

Verily then, the issue of herein private complainant's out-of-court identification of petitioner as the perpetrator of the robbery—which is the fulcrum upon which the ultimate determination of his guilt rests due to the absence of any other evidence presented at trial below—is a question of fact that is cognizable by the Court as an exception, especially if the same was not appreciated or not properly considered by either the trial or the appellate court.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated November 10, 2020 and the Resolution dated October 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43208, as well as the Decision dated March 13, 2019 of Branch 108, Regional Trial Court of Pasay City vis-à-vis Criminal Case No. R-PSY-18-15642-CR, are all hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. For failure on the part of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, petitioner Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged, and is also hereby ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from confinement if he is still so detained, unless he is being held for other lawful cause. Any amount paid by way of bail bond is thus also ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RETURNED to petitioner Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"A.C. No. 12353, February 06, 2024","MELODY H. SANTOS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. EMILIO S. PAÑA, JR., RESPONDENT.","Melody alleged that in 2013, she needed assistance for the declaration of the nullity of her marriage.[3] Hence, she was introduced by a friend of her cousin's wife to one Alberto Santos (Santos).[4] Santos was a court interpreter in Branch 39 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Polomolok, South Cotabato, who allegedly knew a lawyer who could help her obtain a quick nullity of marriage.[5] This lawyer turned out to be Atty. Paña.[6]

Purportedly, Santos, and Atty. Paña claimed that they could obtain a decree of nullity of marriage for Melody within a period of six months, together with the relevant documents from the National Statistics Office (NSO).[7] For their services, Melody paid PHP 280,000.00.[8]

Melody claimed that Atty. Paña eventually provided her with copies of a Judgment dated March 18, 2010 appearing to be issued by Judge Cader P. Indar, al Haj (Judge Indar) of Branch 15 of RTC Cotabato City.[9] She was also given a Certificate of Finality, dated April 14, 2010 stating that the said judgment has become final and executory.[10]

Thereafter, in 2014, Melody applied for her K-1 visa at the United States (US) Embassy in Manila.[11] During her interview, she was informed that the annulment papers she presented were fraudulent.[12] As a result, her application was denied.[13] It was later confirmed that the annulment papers were indeed inauthentic, and not actually issued by Branch 15 of RTC Cotabato City.[14] Notably, Judge Indar has been disbarred by the Court for violating the CPR.[15]

Due to the foregoing, Melody stated that she was forced to hire another lawyer to file another petition for the nullity of her marriage.[16] Further, she had to refile a K-1 visa application with the US Embassy.[17] When she demanded for a refund, Atty. Paña merely returned PHP 260,000.00.[18]

Thus, Melody prayed that Arty. Paña should be disbarred from the practice of law for violating the Lawyer's Oath and Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 and Rule 7.03 of Canon 7 of the CPR.[19]

For his part, Atty. Paña denied the allegations against him.[20] He confirmed that Melody was indeed referred to him for the declaration of the nullity of her marriage.[21] Shortly thereafter, Melody allegedly called him stating that her fiance from the US was in a hurry to bring her there.[22] The said fiance was willing to spend for a quick annulment of Melody's previous marriage.[23] Atty. Paña claimed that he informed Melody that a quick annulment was not possible in South Cotabato.[24]

Verily, Atty. Paña stated that at that time, he encountered one Samuel Guillermo (Guillermo), a court employee who claimed to know a lot of court staff, lawyers, and businessmen, who successfully secured the annulment of their marriages in Cotabato.[25] When Melody reached out again to Atty. Paña, she allegedly asked that she be referred to someone who could provide her immediate assistance.[26] She also stated that she will no longer be engaging Atty. Paña's legal services.[27] Due to her earnest request, Atty. Paña referred her to Guillermo.[28]

More than a year later, Melody purportedly requested for a meeting with Atty. Paña.[29] It was only then that he was informed that the annulment papers were not honored by the NSO.[30] He then advised Melody to ask for a refund from Guillermo, but she pressed that Atty. Paña should assist her in demanding for the refund.[31] Purportedly Guillermo gradually paid Melody by depositing the money to her Metrobank account.[32]

Atty. Paña insisted that if ever he committed lapses, it was referring Melody to Guillermo.[33] He stated that in his journey as a lawyer, this was perhaps the indiscretion of a lifetime.[34] He apologized for not being prudent enough in making the said referral, as Guillermo assisted Melody in taking a shortcut of the regular procedure for the annulment of her marriage.[35]

Verily, on July 1, 2019, the present complaint was referred by the Court to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report, and recommendation.[36]","A lawyer's participation in the falsification of court documents is a reprehensible act which merits administrative sanction. It is directly contradictory to the oath one takes upon becoming a member of the Bar and shows unworthiness to continue in the practice of law.

The Case

This involves an administrative Complaint[1] filed with the Court by Melody H. Santos (Melody) against respondent Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr. (Atty. Paña) for committing gross immoral conduct, in violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).[2]","The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP BOG.

Time and again, it has been emphasized that the lawyers are expected to remain highly ethical and strictly observe the rules of the profession.[47] Failure to adhere to this standard would result in the Court's exercise of its power to discipline members of the bar.[48] Using such power, the Court calls lawyers to account for their mistakes as officers of the Court, for the purpose of preserving the purity of the profession and the proper administration of justice.[49]

On this note, the falsification of court documents has been treated as an act which reflects a high degree of moral turpitude on a lawyer.[50] It is deemed as an offense amounting to unlawful, dishonest, immoral, and deceitful conduct, and has the effect of lessening the confidence of the public in the legal system.[51] Due to the damage and prejudice caused by this offense, the Court has pronounced that it exhibits one's inability to discharge his or her duties as a member of the bar.[52]

In this regard, Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR provides that lawyers should not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct. Rule 7.03, Canon 7 thereof also states that they should not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law. Similarly, both the Lawyer's Oath and Rule 10.01, Canon 10 of the CPR mandate lawyers to not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court.

Verily, A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), was recently issued by the Court, which repealed the CPR and took effect on May 29, 2023.[53] Notably, the CPRA includes a transitory provision which states that it shall be applied to all pending and future cases, unless not feasible or would work injustice.[54] As the exceptions are not present in the instant case, the Court deems the application of the CPRA to be proper.[55]

The pertinent provisions in the CPRA which enjoin lawyers from performing improper acts, particularly the participation in the falsification of court decisions, orders, or documents, are the following:[56]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr. GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and the Lawyer's Oath. He is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ordered STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr.'s personal records as attorney. Likewise, let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts in the country."
"A.C. No. 13753, February 06, 2024 ","JULIETA L. CO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JORGE P. MONROY, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in July 2000, Atty. Monroy offered to sell a Toyota Land Cruiser for PHP 1.4 million to Julieta. The vehicle was among the vehicles confiscated by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) where Atty. Monroy worked as Director III of Financial Services. Atty. Monroy assured Julieta that the transaction is legal and that official receipts will be issued in their favor. On July 12, 2000, Julieta, her sister Maria Victoria L. Que and her husband Romeo Que (Spouses Que) went to the office of Atty. Monroy at the South Pier, Manila. Atty. Monroy introduced them to Remus Erlan S. Palmos (Palmos), who is his nephew and personal staff and a certain Ben Valic (Valic), a licensed broker, as the persons who will facilitate the release of the vehicle. Palmos and Valic brought them to the vehicle depot of the BOC to inspect the vehicle. Having known Atty. Monroy since her high school days as a trusted family friend, Julieta was convinced to proceed with the purchase of the Land Cruiser.[2]

Upon Atty. Monroy's instructions, Julieta and Spouses Que prepared a check for PHP 150,000.00 payable to cash. They gave the check personally to Atty. Monroy on July 18, 2000 and were told to return on July 21, 2000 to pay the balance. On July 21, 2000, Atty. Monroy called Julieta to inform her that the vehicle is ready for delivery. She prepared a manager's check for the balance of PHP 1,250,000.00 but Atty. Monroy insisted on cash payment, which he personally received in his office. They waited the whole day for the release of the vehicle and were later told that one signatory from the Department of Finance (DOF) had yet to sign the documents for the release of the vehicle.[3]

When they returned on July 24, 2000, Atty. Monroy again told them that one signature was lacking from an officer of the DOF. On the same day, Palmos accompanied them to the DOF. Palmos spoke to two unidentified persons at the lobby of the DOF. He then told Julieta that the documents are still in the office of Undersecretary Cornelio Giron. They went back to the office of Atty. Monroy wherein the latter admitted that the vehicle cannot be released because someone ran off with the money and can no longer be located. To appease their worries, Atty. Monroy and Palmos issued a receipt to guarantee the return of the money. Julieta made repeated demands for Atty. Monroy to return her money to no avail as he kept on avoiding her and her relatives.[4]

Consequently, on January 24, 2003, Julieta caused the filing of two Informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768 against Atty. Monroy: one for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and another one for estafa under the Revised Penal Code.[5] After trial, the Sandiganbayan issued a Decision[6] finding Atty. Monroy guilty of both charges.[7] In view of the absence of Atty. Monroy and his counsel during the scheduled promulgation on September 30, 2010, the Decision of conviction was promulgated in absentia. Atty. Monroy remained at-large despite the warrant of arrest issued by the Sandiganbayan.[8]

Apart from his criminal liability, Julieta filed the present administrative complaint for disbarment on the ground that Atty. Monroy acted in utter bad faith by using his position in the government to defraud her to part with PHP 1.4 million. He abused Julieta's trust as a friend to get money for the supposed payment for the negotiated sale of a vehicle from the BOC. Atty. Monroy failed to maintain the highest degree of morality required of those admitted to the Bar. He committed a dishonest, immoral, and unlawful act in gross violation of the provisions of the CPR. Finally, Julieta maintains that Atty. Monroy's conviction for the crimes involving moral turpitude are valid grounds for his disbarment.[9]",This resolves the Complaint-Affidavit[1] for disbarment filed by complainant Julieta L. Co (Julieta) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) against respondent Atty. Jorge P. Monroy (Atty. Monroy) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).,"To begin, the Court observed that all the notices sent by the IBP to Atty. Monroy's last known addresses, i.e., Order[19] dated October 1, 2013, Notice of Mandatory Conference,[20] and the subsequent notices,[21] were returned unserved. Thus, in a Resolution[22] dated July 25, 2023, the Court ordered the IBP-CBD to: (1) verify and inform the Court whether Atty. Monroy was duly notified of the disbarment proceedings; and (2) to submit the last known addresses of Atty. Monroy.[23]

In a letter[24] dated November 16, 2023, Atty. Avelino V. Sales (Atty. Sales) manifested that the IBP-CBD can no longer verify whether the previous notices were received by Atty. Monroy as the entire records of the case were forwarded to the Office of the Bar Confidant. In any case, Atty. Sales informed the Court that the last Notice of Resolution dated October 1, 2022 sent by the IBP-CBD to Atty. Monroy was similarly returned to the Commission.[25] Without doubt, the difficulty in serving notices to Atty. Monroy was due to his own failure to comply with his duty as a lawyer to report any change of his addresses with IBP.[26] Therefore, the Court considers Atty. Monroy to have waived his right to refute the allegations against him. We will proceed to resolve the present administrative charge based on the evidence at hand.

The Court adopts the findings of the IBP-CBD, as affirmed by the IBP Board of Governors, and sustains the IBP Board of Governor's Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2022-10-07 recommending the disbarment of Atty. Monroy.

Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with continuing requirements. To maintain one's standing in the legal profession, a lawyer is required to conduct dealings with honesty, fidelity, and integrity at all times. Being a mere privilege, the practice of law may be suspended, or even withdrawn by the Court once it is shown that a lawyer was not able to sustain the high degree of good moral character expected by the community from the members of the legal profession.[27] Thus, in disbarment proceedings, the only issue to be resolved is whether a lawyer is worthy to continue his or her mandate as an officer of the court.[28]

Here, it is undisputed that Atty. Monroy was adjudged guilty of estafa and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in the Sandiganbayan's Decision[29] in Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768. Indeed, a lawyer may be disbarred for his or her conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude as provided under Rule 138, Section 27[30] of the Rules of Court. However, in Buenafe v. Commission on Elections,[31] the Court clarified that not every criminal act involves moral turpitude, as this does not include offenses that are not of themselves immoral, but only prohibited by law.[32] In Teves v. Commission on Elections,[33] moral turpitude was defined as those acts done contrary to justice, modesty, or good morals, depicting vileness or depravity in the private and social duties of a person.[34]

With regard to the charge of estafa, there is no question that this crime involves moral turpitude. The Court has invariably ruled that a lawyer who was convicted of estafa is totally unfit to be a member of the legal profession and aid in the administration of justice.[35] However, to serve as sufficient ground for disbarment, it must be shown that the conviction has already attained finality.[36]

In this case, Julieta alleged that due to the non-appearance of Atty. Monroy during the scheduled promulgation on September 30, 2010 the Sandiganbayan promulgated the Decision in absentia. Atty. Monroy's motion for reconsideration was denied by the Sandiganbayan. There being no appeal filed by Atty. Monroy, the Decision became final and executory.[37] The Court notes that aside from the copy of the Decision, there was no other evidence presented to show that the Decision has become final. Julieta did not submit a copy of the Order given in open court during the promulgation of Decision wherein Atty. Monroy failed to appear, or the Resolution denying his motion for reconsideration, or certificate of finality or entry of Decision in Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768. Unfortunately, the Court cannot assume that the Decision of conviction against Atty. Monroy is already final.

Despite this, the Court still finds Atty. Monroy's disbarment justified for his violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 6, Rule 6.02 of the CPR, which state:","WHEREFORE, premises considered, Judgment is hereby rendered in these cases as follows:

1. In Criminal Case No. 27767: Finding accused Jorge Paguntalan Monroy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Sec. 3(e), [Republic Act] No. 3019, as amended, and sentencing him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum, to twelve (12) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office;

2. In Criminal Case No. 27768: Finding accused Jorge Paguntalan Monroy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa as defined and penalized under Art. 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum; and return to private offended party Julieta Lim-Co the amount of One Million Four Hundred Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 1,400,000.00)."
"G.R. No. 262193, February 06, 2024","DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","To recall, on March 7, 2005, DBP issued Circular No. 10 which authorized the computation of the MVLC of its official and employees based on their ""gross monthly cash compensation"" composed of basic salary, officer's allowance, Representation and Transportation Allowances, Personnel Economic Relief Allowances, Additional Compensation, meal, children's, and family allowances, including longevity pay.[4] On February 28, 2007, the COA issued various NDs[5] covering the period from March to December 2005, in the total amount of P26,182,467.36. It held that the MVLC should be based on basic pay.[6] DBP sought reconsideration which the Supervising Auditor (SA) denied since the ""present salary or compensation of DBP officers and employees are without the requisite authority or approval of the Office of the President and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).""[7] DBP appealed to the Cluster Director of the COA. It filed a Memorandum of Appeal on August 24, 2009.[8] Thereafter, it filed a Manifestation and Motion,[9] notifying the COA that then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) approved DBP's Compensation Plan, which allegedly includes DBP Circular No. 10. It argued that PGMA's approval rendered the ground on which the NDs were based moot and academic.[10]

On January 30, 2018, the COA Commission Proper (CP) issued Decision No. 2018-197,[11] partially granting the appeal of DBP. It affirmed the NDs on the payment of the MVLC but held that employees who were passive recipients were not required to refund the amount they received in good faith. The liability shall fall on DBP's Board of Directors (BOD) and officials who approved the payment as they were performing discretionary functions. The COA CP rejected DBP's invocation of PGMA's post facto approval of the bank's Compensation Plan as it was made 18 days before the May 10, 2010 Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections. Under Article XII of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), a government official cannot give any increase in salary or remuneration or privilege to any government official or employee 45 days before a regular election.[12]

DBP moved for reconsideration which the COA CP denied in its Decision No. 2022-072[13] dated January 24, 2022. The COA CP affirmed its earlier Decision with modification in that even the passive recipients of the MVLC are required to refund the illegally disbursed amount regardless of their good faith. Thus, DBP filed a petition for certiorari before Us.

In our assailed Decision, We held that: (1) DBP was not denied due process because it was able to present its side and defend its position throughout the proceedings from the SA to the COA CP;[14] (2) COA violated the right to speedy disposition of cases of DBP's officials and employees as it failed to justify the 11 years delay in the resolution of DBP's appeal and motion for reconsideration;[15] (3) there is no res judicata between the present case and the 2021 case of DBP v. COA;[16] (4) DBP Circular No. 10 is inconsistent with the Omnibus Rules on Leave,[17] as amended by Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14-99 and CSC MC No. 8-03, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2002-1 as it uses gross monthly cash compensation instead of basic pay;[18] (5) DBP BOD's power to fix personnel compensation is not absolute and must be in accord with the law and prevailing rules and regulations issued by the President and/or the DBM;[19] (6) DBP Circular No. 10 is not included in the Compensation Plan approved by PGMA;[20] (7) PGMA's approval of the Compensation Plan is invalid as We earlier ruled in the 2022 case of DBP v. COA[21] (2022 DBP case) since it was made during the prohibited period under the OEC;[22] (8) DBP BOD and officers who approved and certified the disallowed MVLC are excused from returning the same due to their good faith reliance on Section 13[23] of DBP's Revised Charter; and (9) Recipients of the MVLC are likewise absolved from returning the disallowed amounts under Rule 2d of Madera v. Commission on Audit[24] on the ground of undue prejudice caused by the COA's violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases.[25]

In this Motion for Partial Reconsideration, DBP alleges that Our finding that COA violated DBP's right to speedy disposition of cases warrants the dismissal and nullification of the NDs. It claims that We should not have merely affirmed with modification COA Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022.[26] It further argues that the COA has no power to determine if PGMA's approval of its Compensation Plan violated the OEC because only the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) could make such a determination.[27]","Before Us is a Motion for Partial Reconsideration[1] of Our Decision[2] dated July 11, 2023 (assailed Decision), which affirmed with modification the Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022 of the Commission on Audit (COA). The COA disallowed the payment of the money value of the leave credits (MVLC) of the officials and employees of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) computed based on their gross monthly cash compensation. In Our assailed Decision, We absolved the persons identified as liable under Notices of Disallowance (NDs) Nos. HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (01-01) to HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (01-03), all dated February 28, 2007 and ND No. HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (03) dated July 4, 2007 from refunding the disallowed amounts therein.[3]","We grant the Motion for Partial Reconsideration.

In Navarro v. Commission on Audit[28] (Navarro) and Rosario v. Commission on Audit[29] (Rosario), We held that the COA was guilty of violating therein petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases due to inordinate delay in resolving the appeal and motion for reconsideration before it. Navarro and Rosario involved 7 and 11 years of delay, respectively. In both cases, We reversed and set aside the Decisions of the COA and relieved petitioners of any liability for the disallowed amounts.

Conformably with Navarro and Rosario, We also now set aside the challenged Decisions of the COA in the present case and excuse DBP and its officials and employees on account of the COA's violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases.

Here, COA failed to discharge its burden of proving that the 11-year delay in the resolution of DBP's case is justified and reasonable. On pages 11-12 of Our assailed Decision, We ruled that:
On the matter of DBP's right to speedy disposition of cases, We find that the COA is guilty of violating the same. Section 16, Article III of the Constitution provides that all persons shall have the right to speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative bodies. Any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice. In determining whether the right to speedy disposition of cases is violated, several factors are considered such as: (a) the length of delay; (b) the reasons for such delay; (c) the assertion or failure to assert such right; and (c) the prejudice caused by the delay.

We measure the length of delay in conjunction with the period for which the COA should have decided the case before it. Under Section 7, Article IX(A), of the Constitution, the COA shall decide any case or matter brought before it within 60 days from its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon filing the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself. In this case, DBP filed its Memorandum of Appeal before the COA Cluster Director on August 24, 2009, while the COA Auditor filed a Consolidated Reply Memorandum on August 25, 2009. The COA CP rendered the assailed Decision No. 2018-197 on January 30, 2018 or more than eight years from the submission of the Reply Memorandum. Likewise, the COA took its time in resolving DBP's motion for reconsideration of the Decision No. 2018-197. DBP filed the motion on October 17, 2018 but it was only on January 24, 2022 or more than three years after the COA issued Decision No. 2022-072.

Since the delay in the disposition of the case extended to years, way beyond the mandate of the Constitution and the COA's own rules of procedure, it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove that the delay was reasonable, or that the delay was not attributable to it. To justify the delay in this case, the COA argued that it was in the process of amending its Rules of Procedure in 2009 and this might have resulted in unintended delays. We are not persuaded.

The COA itself stated that its new rules was approved on September 15, 2009, while the delay in this case spanned from August 2009 to January 2018 and November 2018 to January 2022 for the appeal and the motion for reconsideration, respectively. Clearly, the COA had already finished the amendments of its rules during the long hiatus of the case. It did not substantiate the so-called ""organizational adjustments"" brought about by the amendments that caused the delay in the disposition of the case. Hence, such cannot excuse the COA's inaction for a total of 11 years.","WHEREFORE, the Partial Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022 of the Commission on Audit are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE on account of the violation of the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases of petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines and its officials and employees."

DENNIS HERNANDEZ Y CARINGAL AND MARIA CRISTINA ANONUEVO Y CORIANA,* ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","The case stemmed from two separate criminal Complaints. In Criminal Case No. 12-292735, Hernandez and Anonuevo were charged in an Amended Information[6] with qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 3(a) and 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, committed as follows:

That sometime on June 23, 2012 or there about, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Dennis Hernandez and Maria Cristina Anonuevo, for the purpose of sexual exploitation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly, conspired and confederated with each other in recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring, providing, and/or receiving AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX,"" 17 years old, from the City of XXXXX to the province of XXXXX under the pretext of domestic employment as a house helper, with the intent of forcing her to have sex with Maria Cristina Anonuevo's live-in partner, Dennis Hernandez, and latter, with threat and intimidation, sexually abused and exploited said AAA, to the latter's damage and prejudice. That subsequently thereafter, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating with each other, forced and threatened AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX"" to find her replacement and bring her to Dennis Hernandez on July 02, 2012, or there about, for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

This case is attendant with the qualifying circumstance of Minority being that AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX,"" was seventeen (17) years old when the crime was committed against her.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7] (Emphasis in the original)

In the original case, docketed as Criminal Case No. 6858, Hernandez and Anonuevo were indicted in an Information[8] for violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, committed as follows:

That on June 23, 2012 or there about, in the Province of xxxxx, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, through threat and intimidation, conspiring and confederating with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly, induce AAA, seventeen (17) years old, to indulge in sexual intercourse and lascivious conduct for money, profit, and any other consideration, against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of the said minor child.","This Court resolves the appeal[1] filed by accused-appellants Dennis Hernandez y Caringal (Hernandez) and Maria Cristina Anonuevo y Coriana (Anonuevo) assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modification the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding Hernandez and Anonuevo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of:
1) qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Sections 3(a), 6(a), and 10(a) of Republic Act No. 9208,[4] otherwise known as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003; and

2) violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610,[5] otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.","The appeal is bereft of merit.

Factual findings of trial courts are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal, especially when affirmed by the CA. This great respect lies in the trial court's firsthand access to the evidence presented during the trial, and in its direct observation of the witnesses and their demeanor while they testify on the occurrences and events attested to.[53] However, this rule does not apply where material facts have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the lower courts.[54]

After a careful scrutiny of the records, we find no cogent reason to deviate from the uniform findings of the CA and RTC that the prosecution established by the required quantum of evidence, the elements of the crimes charged for reasons which shall be discussed ad seriatim.

In Criminal Case No. 12-292735, accused-appellants were charged with and convicted of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208.

At this juncture, it is worth noting that Republic Act No. 9208 was amended by Republic Act No. 10364[55] on February 6, 2013, and further amended by Republic Act No. 11862[56] on June 23, 2022. However, since the alleged act of trafficking was committed by accused-appellants on June 23, 2012, or prior to the enactment of both amendatory laws, the original law remains applicable in the resolution of the instant case.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9208 defines ""trafficking in persons,"" ""prostitution,"" and ""sexual exploitation"" as follows:

SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act:

(a) Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of other or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.

(c) Prostitution – refers to any act, transaction, scheme or design involving the use of a person by another, for sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct in exchange for money, profit or any other consideration.

. . . .

(f) Sexual Exploitation – refers to participation by a person in prostitution or the production or pornographic materials as a result of being subjected to a threat, deception, coercion, abduction, force, abuse of authority, debt bondage, fraud or through abuse of a victim's vulnerability.

A conviction for qualified trafficking in persons rests upon: (a) the commission of any of the specific acts constituting trafficking in persons enumerated under Section 4 (Acts of Trafficking in Person) or Section 5 (Acts that Promote Trafficking in Persons); and (b) the existence of any of the qualifying circumstance listed under Section 6 (Qualified Trafficking in Persons). The provisions relevant to the case at hand are quoted below:

SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer; harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;

"G.R. No. 235894, February 05, 2024","KAREN BALDOVINO CHUA, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE NOEL B. DE CASTRO, RESPONDENT.","In a Complaint[5] lodged before the RTC against Jose Noel B. De Castro (respondent) for rescission, breach of contract, and damages, petitioner averred that she and her husband engaged his services for the construction of a two-storey residential building. Owing to respondent's years of experience and the fact of him being the first cousin of petitioner's mother, no written contract was executed between the parties.[6] Respondent prepared and proposed the building plans, designs, and material specifications, which petitioner and her husband acceded to.[7] They likewise provided all the funding respondent requested from them, which amounted to PHP 2,241,600.00 as of the institution of the complaint.[8] However, a month after petitioner and her family moved to the newly-constructed house, they noticed several structural and architectural defects such as leaking ceilings, flooding on the ground floor, cracks on the doors, and plumbing issues. The services of another foreman had to be engaged when respondent failed to resolve such defects.[9] The repairs done by the foreman to address the defects as well as the subsequent inspections conducted by a new engineer all revealed that respondent compromised on the work done and the materials he used.[10] It was also discovered that he deviated from the structural plan agreed upon.[11] The dispute was then referred to the Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay Quezon, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya.[12]

During the first hearing before the Lupong Tagapamayapa, respondent acknowledged the existence of the construction agreement and the receipt of the amount detailed by petitioner and her husband.[13] Despite several hearings, the parties failed to resolve their differences, impelling the Punong Barangay to issue a Certificate to File Action.[14] Afterwards, petitioner instituted her complaint.

On account of respondent's failure to submit any responsive pleading notwithstanding the summons served on him,[15] petitioner filed a Motion to Declare Defendant in Default.[16] She beseeched the RTC to proceed and render judgment based on the complaint.

In the first inveighed Order,[17] the RTC held that pursuant to Circular No. 103-2015 of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), the complaint had to be dismissed and referred to the Construction Industry Arbitration Committee (CIAC), the same being the tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes. The trial court held that the allegations in the complaint placed the controversy within the jurisdiction of the CIAC and as such, it was exercising its discretion to dismiss the case motu proprio.[18]

Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the order, which the RTC denied in the second oppugned Order.[19]

Through the present direct recourse before this Court on a pure question of law, petitioner argues that the RTC erred in dismissing her complaint for want of jurisdiction. She insists that under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 1008,[20] parties must agree to submit the dispute to the CIAC for voluntary arbitration before the tribunal can exercise its jurisdiction. In this instance, there was neither a construction contract with an arbitration clause nor a subsequent agreement from the parties to submit their case for arbitration.[21]

In the Court's Resolution[22] dated March 12, 2018, respondent was directed to file his comment on the Petition. After the lapse of the original period provided him, another Resolution[23] was issued reiterating the directive that he file his comment. Still and all, he deigned to comply with the said directive. Inevitably, on June 10, 2020, he was made to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for ignoring the Court's directives.[24] On June 16, 2021 after the Court had confirmed that its latest Resolution was indeed received by respondent's daughter on September 21, 2020,[25] but that no compliance was received from him, he was held in contempt and fined the sum of PHP 1000.00. Likewise, another reiteration was made for him to file his comment on the Petition.[26]

To date, respondent has neither paid the fine imposed upon him[27] nor filed his comment.

The sole issue for the Court to resolve is whether the RTC erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] impugns the Orders dated August 11, 2017[2] and November 17, 2017[3] of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, which dismissed the civil case filed by Karen Baldovino Chua (petitioner) before it, and denied her Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in Civil Case No. 7389.","At the outset, the Court resolves to DISPENSE WITH respondent's comment due to his repeated failure to file the same.

From a procedural standpoint, the Court affirms the remedy availed by petitioner via an appeal by certiorari under a Rule 45 petition directly filed with the Court. Under Rule 41, Section 2(c), the appeal from a judgment of the RTC must be lodged with the Supreme Court by a Rule 45 petition ""[i]n all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved[.]"" Unquestionably, the issue of determining jurisdiction over a subject matter is a question of law,[28] which snugly falls within this Court's appellate jurisdiction.

On the merits, the Court resolves to GRANT the Petition.

It is well-settled that jurisdiction over the subject matters is conferred by law and not ""by the consent or acquiescence of any or all of the parties or by erroneous belief of the court that it exists.""[29]

The jurisdiction of the CIAC is laid down in Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008:
SECTION 4. Jurisdiction. — The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.... (Emphasis supplied)
Unarguably, the foregoing section provides that when the dispute involves a construction agreement, the law vests jurisdiction with the CIAC so long as the ""the parties agree to submit to voluntary arbitration[.]""[30] In fact, the mere incorporation of an arbitration clause in a construction contract is sufficient to vest the CIAC with jurisdiction.[31] The clause operates as the parties' consent as required by the law, and may not be subjected to any condition or qualification.[32]

This Court has recognized the pivotal role that the CIAC plays in the swift settlement of construction controversies and has adopted policies to ensure that the adjudicative body is ""empowered and enabled to fulfill its function as the professionally authoritative venue for settlement of construction disputes[.]""[33]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The challenged Orders dated August 11, 2017 and November 17, 2017 of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya in Civil Case No. 7389 are SET ASIDE. The case is remanded to the said court a quo, which is DIRECTED to resolve the case with dispatch.

The Clerk of Court is likewise DIRECTED to execute the fine amounting to PHP 1000 against respondent Jose Noel B. De Castro in accordance with Section 9, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court."
"G.R. No. 264846, February 05, 2024","CCC, PETITIONER, VS. DDD, EEE, FFF, GGG & HHH, RESPONDENTS.*","CCC married the late III in 2006. They begot two children, namely: AAA, who was born in 2006, and BBB, who was born in 2011. After seven years of marriage, their relationship turned sour due to personal differences. As a result, III left the marital home together with their children and sought refuge at her parents' house in xxxxxxxxxxx, North Cotabato. In 2014, the marriage was legally dissolved through a divorce obtained from a Shari'a Court. Three years thereafter, III passed away; AAA and BBB were left under the care and custody of her relatives, the respondents in this case.[6]

Meanwhile, respondent EEE, III's brother, became the judicially appointed guardian of the children.[7]

In 2018, CCC discovered that his children were no longer residing in xxxxxxxxxxx, North Cotabato. He found them living in an apartment in xxxxxxxxxxx with III's siblings. Left without recourse, he filed a petition before the CA seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to regain custody over the minors.[8]

Prior to the final adjudication of the petition, the CA referred the case to Branch xxxxxxxxxxx of the RTC of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, and ordered III's siblings to appear before the trial court together with the children and to show cause why they should not be returned to the custody of CCC.[9]

In his testimony, AAA vividly described how CCC physically abused him, his sister, and their late mother. AAA highlighted a specific incident when CCC traveled to xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato with the sole purpose of threatening III's life. AAA also overheard him explicitly stating that he refuses to acknowledge her as his wife and their children as his own. When given the choice, AAA expressed his preference to live with his mother's siblings instead of CCC. Furthermore, AAA conveyed a deep-seated sense of hatred toward his father.[10]

BBB's testimony aligned with her brother's account. She expressed her desire to remain in the care of her aunts and uncles, as they had treated her kindly. She intimated her reluctance to live with CCC because he already has another wife and children.[11]

As III's relatives, respondents explicated that they had been entrusted with the care of the children following her death. However, it was EEE who officially filed and obtained the petition for guardianship over the minors. Despite EEE's work as a seaman abroad, he consistently provided monthly support of PHP 40,000.00 for the children. Respondents expressed their strong desire to maintain custody of the children, citing concerns about CCC's inability to provide them proper care. They also provided detailed accounts of the hardships that their sister endured during the years she lived with him.[12]

In response, CCC vehemently denied abandoning III and their children for another woman. He claimed entering into a new relationship only after separating from III. He accused respondents of influencing his children's perspective, leading them to reject the idea of living with him. He expressed his strong desire to personally raise and provide guidance to his children while acknowledging and striving to address his past shortcomings. Despite having a new family, he avouched that his new wife willingly agreed to take the children into their household.[13]

In due course, the RTC denied the habeas corpus and custody petition and refused to grant CCC custody over the minors. The fallo of the Judgment reads:
WHEREFORE, the Court finds no cogent reason to grant the herein petition for habeas corpus and custody of minors AAA and BBB to herein petitioner, thus, hereby DENIES the same and judgment is hereby rendered:
That the custody over the person of minors AAA and BBB shall remain with EEE, the guardian designated and appointed by the Court in Spl. Proc. No. 17-010, rendered by the RTC, Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato;

That petitioner is ordered to give monthly financial support to AAA and BBB necessary for their support, maintenance and education, in the sum of [PHP] 40,000.00, for the two of them, which amount was the financial support that EEE has been providing the minors, and may be increased depending upon the needs of the children;

Direct the Social Welfare Officer of the LSWDO of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, to conduct a thorough and continuous counselling to the minors, AAA and BBB, including the guardian, to prepare the minors emotionally and psychologically in allowing the petitioner to visit them, and if the children are already prepared for the visitation, to schedule the time of visitation which is the most convenient to the minor children, and submit a case study and report on the continuous counselling being undertaken to the Court. Counselling must be done immediately, and upon coordination with guardian appointed by the Court;

Direct the petitioner to undergo psychological and psychiatric counselling, to prepare him of his responsibilities toward his children, and to consult with the local Social Welfare Officer of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, for the conduct of said counselling; [and]

Grant unto the petitioner visitation rights, upon the recommendation of the Social Welfare Officer, when the minor­children AAA and BBB are already ready and willing to allow the petitioner to visit them, and the visitation period must be scheduled in accordance with what is most convenient to the minor children[.]","This Verified Appeal by Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court rails against the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Judgment[4] rendered by Branch xxxxxxxxxxx of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, denying the petition for habeas corpus and custody of minors filed by CCC, and which gave short shrift to the Motion for Reconsideration (Of the Decision dated June 21, 2022),[5] respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 10277-MIN.","After a percipient study of the case at bench, the Court rules and so holds to deny the Petition.

The CA committed no reversible error in affirming the trial court's denial of CCC's petition for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus and in refusing to grant him custody of his minor children.

A writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases where the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the persons entitled thereto. In cases involving minors, the purpose of a petition for habeas corpus is not limited to the production of the child before the court. The main purpose of the petition for habeas corpus is to determine who has the rightful custody over the child.[19] In deciding custody issues, the child's welfare is the most important consideration.[20]

Along this grain, the trial court must carefully consider the totality of the circumstances. Ultimately, such issue is factual in nature, which the Court is not tasked to undertake under a Rule 45 petition as it is not a trier of facts.[21] Thus, as a matter of sound practice and procedure, the Court defers and accords finality to the factual findings of trial courts.[22]

In the case at bench, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, found that AAA and BBB are better off living with respondents, who are III's relatives.

The Court could not agree more.","ACCORDINGLY, the Verified Appeal by Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The June 21, 2022 Decision and the November 14, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 10277-MIN are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 264913, February 05, 2024 ","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RONALD PARADERO APORADO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Ronald was charged with murder for stabbing Amado B. Halasan (Amado) in an Information that reads:
That sometime on January 28, 2017, in the Municipality of Bansalan, Province of Davao del Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, and with intent to kill, armed with a bolo, with treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Amado B. Halasan in a sudden and unexpected manner without giving the victim the chance to defend himself a mode of attack which the accused consciously and deliberately adopted inflicting upon him stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which caused his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
When arraigned, Ronald pleaded not guilty to the charge.[5] At the trial, the prosecution proved that on January 28, 2017, Ronald, alias Tunay, Jay Amoy (Jay), Amado, and Fritz Montalba (Fritz) were having a drinking spree outside the house of Jomar Amoy (Jomar) in Sitio San Roque, Barangay Mabuhay, Bansalan, Davao del Sur.[6] The group teased Ronald that he looked like a killer and told him that he was ugly.[7] Amado even challenged Ronald if he knew how to kill a person.[8] Unknown to the group, Ronald was enraged by their mockery. He took it to mean that the group degraded his person. After while, Ronald's sister called and asked him to go home since he was already drunk.[9] Ronald went home as instructed. When he returned, Jay offered him a drink. Suddenly, Ronald tried to punch Amado, but Jay held his, hand.[10] Jay then noticed that Ronald had a knife, so he let go of Ronald's hand and ran towards Jomar's house. Fritz followed.[11] Inside, Jay saw Ronald stab Amado several times in the breast area.[12] At that time, Amado was asleep and seated with his head bowed.[13]

After that, Ronald went to the house of Rey Amoy, came back with a backpack, and again stabbed Amado while shouting, ""do you think that I do not know how to kill a person. I have killed many times.""[14] Ronald left with a warning that he will kill them all.[15] Amado was brought to Centeno Hospital where he was proclaimed dead on arrival.[16]

Ronald was apprehended by barangay tanod Janilo Espinosa (Janilo) along the road going to New Visayas. Janilo bodily frisked him and saw a knife in his backpack.[17] He then brought Ronald to the barangay hall. When asked why he stabbed Amado, Ronald answered that he just liked to kill (""natripingan lang niya"").[18]","We review in this appeal[1] the conviction of Ronald Paradero Aporado (Ronald) for the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in the Decision[2] dated November 18, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated April 20, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The burden of evidence is shifted to the accused, and they must rely on the strength of their own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution, for even if the latter were weak, it would not be disbelieved after their open admission of responsibility for the killing.[38]

Here, Ronald admitted that he killed Amado. He testified in open court how he was enraged by the mockery of Jay, Fritz, and Amado that he decided to go home, get a knife, and stab Amado to death:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 214074, February 05, 2024","PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. MEDIAN CONTAINER CORPORATION AND ELDON INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","On November 2, 2010, respondents Median Container Corporation (Median) and Eldon Industrial Corporation (collectively, respondents) filed a complaint[6] for Reformation of Instrument before the RTC. The complaint alleged that to finance the purchase of various goods needed for their businesses, they availed of a credit line with PNB in the amount of PHP 50 Million, with fixed amortization and interest. Instead of the usual promissory notes and other loan documents, PNB purportedly lured them into signing trust receipts, which did not reflect their real agreement, to coerce them as well as their officers to pay whatever billing sent to them under the pain of criminal prosecution.[7]

In its Answer with Counterclaim,[8] PNB argued that the complaint should be dismissed because the trust receipts reflected their real agreement. It claimed that there was no enticement involved in the execution thereof because the provisions were freely agreed upon and voluntarily executed by both parties. It claimed that the complaint was a mere ploy on respondents' part to evade their obligations and escape possible criminal prosecution for estafa as they failed to turn over the proceeds of the sale of the goods or return the goods covered by the trust receipts in violation of the Trust Receipts Law. Thus, PNB sought to implead Spouses Ley, as President and Vice-President/Treasurer of Median, to hold them severally liable with respondents and collect from them the sum of PHP 31,059,616.29.[9]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) assailing the Decision[2] dated March 19, 2014 and the Resolution[3] dated August 18, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The assailed CA rulings affirmed the Resolutions dated February 14, 2011[4] and July 29, 2011[5] issued by Branch 91, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City (RTC) which dismissed, without prejudice, PNB's counterclaim and denied its motion to implead Spouses Carlos and Fely Ley (Spouses Ley).","The Petition is without merit.

At the outset, the Court notes that PNB's arguments are mere rehash of those it raised before the CA, which have already been sufficiently addressed and resolved in its rulings. More significantly, the issues that PNB raises in the instant petition, i.e., whether its counterclaim is compulsory and whether Spouses Ley should have been impleaded, require a review of the pleadings and arguments raised, as well as the findings of the CA, including those of the RTC, which are not proper in a Rule 45 petition where only questions of law are allowed.[30]

At any rate, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in upholding the RTC ruling that dismissed PNB's counterclaim, including the motion to implead Spouses Ley, for lack of merit.

It bears stressing that under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court's review of the CA Decision is discretionary and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons for it such as when the court a quo has: (a) decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or (b) so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.[31]

None of these reasons were shown to exist in this case.

A counterclaim is defined as any claim for money or other relief which a defending party may have against an opposing party.[32] A counterclaim is considered compulsory if: (a) it arises out of, or is necessarily connected with, the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; (b) it does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction; and (c) the court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim.[33] In other words, a compulsory counterclaim cannot be made the subject of a separate action but should be asserted in the same suit involving the same transaction or occurrence giving rise to it.[34]

To determine whether a counterclaim is compulsory, the following tests apply: (1) Are the issues of fact and law raised by the claim and counterclaim largely the same?; (2) Would res judicata bar a subsequent suit on defendant's claim absent the compulsory counterclaim rule?; (3) Will substantially the same evidence support or refute plaintiffs claim as well as defendant's counterclaim?; and (4) Is there any logical relation between the claim and the counterclaim?[35] A positive answer to all four questions would indicate that the counterclaim is compulsory. Otherwise, it is permissive.[36]

Another test established by case law is the ""compelling test of compulsoriness"" which requires ""a logical relationship between the claim and counterclaim, that is, where conducting separate trials of the respective claims of the parties would entail a substantial duplication of effort and time by the parties and the court.""[37]

Applying the foregoing standards, the Court agrees that PNB's counterclaim for collection of sum of money is merely permissive.

First, the issue in the main case, i.e., whether the parties' real agreement is a loan or some other contract and not a trust receipt agreement, is entirely different from the issues in the counterclaim, i.e., whether respondents secured an obligation from PNB, the total amount due, and that they refused to pay despite demand.

Case law characterizes reformation of an instrument as a remedy in equity where a written instrument already executed is allowed by law to be reformed or construed to express or conform to the real intention of the parties. The rationale of the doctrine is that it would be unjust and inequitable to allow the enforcement of a written instrument that does not express or reflect the real intention of the parties.[38] To support an action for reformation, the petitioner/complainant must present evidence establishing the alleged real agreement between the parties, in addition to the instrument sought to be reformed.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court resolves to DENY the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Decision dated March 19, 2014 and the Resolution dated August 18, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 121782 are hereby AFFIRMED."
