"G.R. No. 258194, May 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant was charged in eight separate Informations as follows:
Criminal Case No. 2017-0198
Violation of Sec. 5 (a)(l), Art. III of Republic Act No. 7610

That on or about December 31, 2016, in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines[5] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally acted as procurer of herein complaining witness [AAA][6] (DOB: October 26, 2003), a 13[-] year[-]old minor, to an unidentified male ""GUEST"", for sexual favor, thus engaging and facilitating child prostitution for monetary consideration, thus subjecting her to [a] condition [that is] prejudicial to her development as a child, to her damage and prejudice.","Accused-appellant XXX assails the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12128, which affirmed with modification the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx in Criminal Case Nos. 2017-0198, 2017-0203, 2017-0202, 2017-0201, 2017-0200, 2017-0199, 2017-0685 and 2017-0686, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of:

(1) two counts of violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610[4], otherwise known as the ""Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act;""

(2) three counts of violation of Section 5(a)(l) of Republic Act No. 7610;
and

(3) three counts of violation of Section 4(a) in relation to Sections 6(a) and 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, otherwise known as the ""Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003,"" as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.","he appeal is bereft of merit.

Accused-appellant argues that the inconsistencies in the statements given by the private complainant cast doubt on his guilt thereby warranting his acquittal. He posits that the private complainant was unsure as regards the date when accused-appellant started sexually exploiting her. This allegedly shows that the private complainant's account was not categorical or straightforward, thus eroding her credibility as a witness, as she could not have been mistaken of such a fateful tribulation allegedly involving the accused-appellant, had it ever truly happened.[62] Further, accused-appellant argues that private complainant's admission that she was already engaged in this kind of activity prior to their meeting on December 31, 2016 casts doubt as to his culpability. He emphasizes that it is highly unlikely that he or anybody for that matter, would still need to act as a procurer of private complainant when the latter, on her own, already knows well the loops of the trade.[63]

We are not convinced. It is a well-settled rule that ""if the testimonial inconsistencies do not hinge on any essential element of the crime, such inconsistencies are deemed insignificant and will not have any bearing on the essential fact or facts testified to. These inconsistencies, if at all, even indicate that the witness was not rehearsed.""[64] 
 
Accused-appellant is guilty of two counts of violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610
 

The RTC and the CA convicted accused-appellant of two counts of sexual intercourse committed against children exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse in violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No 7610 for forcing himself upon the victim twice, on January 3 and 5, 2017.

Jurisprudence dictates the essential elements of violation of Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 are as follows: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[65]

All the elements are present in the case at bar.","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The assailed January 29, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12128 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. Accused-appellant XXX is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of:

SB-17-CRM-2397, SB-17-CRM-2398, and SB-17-CRM-2400, filed by Augustus Caesar L. Moreno (accused-appellant Augustus) and Evangeline D. Manigos (accused­appellant Manigos) (collectively, accused-appellants).","The Court grants the appeal.

The right to speedy disposition of cases is provided for in Section 16,[70] Article III, of the 1987 Constitution. In determining whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated, the following guidelines in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan[71] must be considered:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-­finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.

In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is granted. The Decision dated February 22, 2022, and Resolution dated May 23, 2022, of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-2397, SB-17-CRM- 2398, and SB-17-CRM-2400 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE:

"G.R. No. 239829, May 29, 2024","NATIONAL GRID CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, RESPONDENT.","On December 12, 2011, the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) and Meralco entered into a Contract to Sell[5] covering the following sub-transmission lines/assets (STAs):
(a) Dasmariñas-Abubot Rosario 115 kV Line;
(b) Rosario S/S Equipment;
(c) Tayabas 115 kV Switchyard; and
(d) Ternate S/S Equipment.[6]
A Joint Application[7] was filed by TRANSCO and Meralco with the ERC on April 17, 2012. They sought for the approval of the sale of the subject STAs in favor of Meralco under the terms of their Contract to Sell.[8]

Finding the Joint Application sufficient in form and substance, the ERC issued an Order and Notice of Public Hearing setting the case for initial hearing on July 4, 2012.[9]

Petitioner National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) filed a Petition for Intervention (With Opposition)[10] on June 29, 2015 claiming that it was not informed about the sale contract between TRANSCO and Meralco. NGCP based its cause on its authority and responsibility to operate, manage, and maintain the nationwide transmission system of the Philippines under Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the ""Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2011"" (EPIRA) and its implementing rules. NGCP averred that in the operation of the subject STAs, it incurred considerable improvement and upgrade costs, which were not considered and included in the sale contract. Accordingly, Meralco, as buyer of the STAs, should pay NGCP the improvement and upgrade costs as additional value to the agreed cost with TRANSCO.[11]

The ERC granted NGCP's Petition for Intervention.[12] Hearings on the Joint Application were conducted.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Amended Decision[2] dated September 15, 2017 and Resolution[3] dated May 31, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 140579. The CA granted the Motion for Reconsideration[4] filed by respondent Manila Electric Company (Meralco) and set aside the Decision and Orders of Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).","The Petition is meritorious.
 
The CA had jurisdiction over Meralco's Petition for Review
 

Preliminarily, the Court affirms the finding of the CA that it has jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review (Rule 43) filed by Meralco. The reckoning time to count the 15-day reglementary period to appeal should be from the receipt of the Third Order denying Meralco's Motion to Re-open Proceedings.

It should be emphasized that the ERC gave due course to Meralco's Motion to Re-open Proceedings and required TRANSCO, NGCP, and PEZA to file comment/opposition.[52] It did not deny outright said motion on the basis that it is a prohibited pleading. The ERC recognized the supervening matters raised in Meralco's motion and the respective comments/opposition of TRANSCO, NGCP, and PEZA. Even in its Opposition[53] to Meralco's Motion, NGCP did not raise any procedural infirmity but foremost refuted the substantial averments in said motion.

The CA was correct in holding that it was only upon the issuance of the Third Order that the ERC can be considered to have issued a judgment that finally disposed of the case, taking into consideration such supervening matters. The First and Second Orders of the ERC did not attain finality since the Motion to Re-open Proceedings is still a continuation of the proceedings in view of the supervening matters raised by Meralco.

Having been filed within the reglementary period, the CA had jurisdiction to resolve Meralco's petition.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED.

That on or about the 29th day of May 2017, in the City of Dumaguete, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, without authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver and give to a police poseur buyer one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance with a weight of 0.04 gram, containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.

(Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs)

That on or about the 29th day of May 2017, in the City of Dumaguete, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, without authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess eleven (11) heat sealed transparent plastic sachets containing a total weight of 0.91 gram, of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride commonly called shabu, a dangerous drug.

The accused has been found positive for the use of Methamphetamine, a dangerous drug, as reflected in Chemistry Report Nos. DT-164-17.","This is a petition[1] filed by Raul Domen y Aurellano (Raul) from the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. SP No. 12222. The assailed CA rulings partially reversed the Joint Judgment[4] and the Orders[5] of Branch 30 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, in Criminal Case No. 2017-24487 and Criminal Case No. 2017-24488. The subject RTC rulings granted Raul's Motion for Plea Bargaining.[6]","The petition is meritorious.

At the outset, the Court takes judicial notice of DOJ Circular No. 18[28] dated May 10, 2022 which expressly revoked DOJ Circular No. 027 dated June 26, 2018. The recent circular aligned its provisions with the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases. Consequently, We deem the prosecution's objection to Raul's plea bargain in Criminal Case No. 2017-­24487 as effectively withdrawn.[29]

In People v. Montierro,[30] the Court laid down the following guidelines to be observed in plea bargaining in drugs cases:
1. Offers for plea bargaining must be initiated in writing by way of a formal written motion filed by the accused in court.

2. The lesser offense which the accused proposes to plead guilty to must necessarily be included in the offense charged.

3. Upon receipt of the proposal for plea bargaining that is compliant with the provisions of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the judge shall order that a drug dependency assessment be administered. If the accused admits drug use, or denies it but is found positive after a drug dependency test, then he/she shall undergo treatment and rehabilitation for a period of not less than six (6) months. Said period shall be credited to his/her penalty and the period of his/her after-care and follow-up program if the penalty is still unserved. If the accused is found negative for drug use/dependency, then he/she will be released on time served, otherwise, he/she will serve his/her sentence in jail minus the counselling period at [a] rehabilitation center.

4. As a rule, plea bargaining requires the mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court. Regardless of the mutual agreement of the parties, the acceptance of the offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the court.
Though the prosecution and the defense may agree to enter into a plea bargain, it does not follow that the courts will automatically approve the proposal. Judges must still exercise sound discretion in granting or denying plea bargaining, taking into account the relevant circumstances, including the character of the accused.
5. The court shall not allow plea bargaining if the objection to the plea bargaining is valid and supported by evidence to the effect that:
the offender is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times; or

when the evidence of guilt is strong.
6. Plea bargaining in drugs cases shall not be allowed when the proposed plea bargain does not conform to the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases.

7. Judges may overrule the objection of the prosecution if it is based solely on the ground that the accused's plea bargaining proposal is inconsistent with the acceptable plea bargain under any internal rules or guidelines of the DOJ, though in accordance with the plea bargaining framework issued by the Court, if any.

8. If the prosecution objects to the accused's plea bargaining proposal due to the circumstances enumerated in item no. 5, the trial court is mandated to hear the prosecution's objection and rule on the merits thereof. If the trial court finds the objection meritorious, it shall order the continuation of the criminal proceedings.

9. If an accused applies for probation in offenses punishable under [Republic Act No.] 9165, other than for illegal drug trafficking or pushing under Section 5 in relation to Section 24 thereof, then the law on probation shall apply.[31]
Here, the State ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC when it approved Raul's plea bargain despite the objection of the prosecution on the ground that DOJ Circular No. 027 prohibits plea bargaining for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5 to the lesser offense of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision and the Resolution dated December 10, 2020 and July 21, 2021, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 12222 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Criminal Case No. 2017-24487 and Criminal Case No. 2017-24488 against Raul Domen y Aurellano are REMANDED to the court of origin to determine: (1) whether the evidence of guilt is strong; and (2) whether Raul Domen y Aurellano is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times.

In case the trial court finds Raul Domen y Aurellano qualified to avail of the benefits of plea bargaining, a drug dependency assessment shall be conducted pursuant to A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC."
"G.R. No. 234681, May 29, 2024","JUANITO ANRO SALVADOR, KEN RUSSEL SALVADOR AND MICHAEL SALVADOR, PETITIONERS, VS. MARIA MINDA A. SALVADOR, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF THE MINORS ALEXIS SALVADOR, JEFFREY SALVADOR, ANTHONY SALVADOR, AND HYACINTH SALVADOR YEE, RESPONDENTS.","Maria Minda A. Salvador (Maria) sought to claim co-ownership over properties inherited by her brother-in-law, Juanito Anro Salvador (Juanito) from the latter's parents Anatolio Salvador (Anatolio) and Rosario Canoy Salvador (Rosario). Maria insisted that her late husband, Franklin Salvador (Franklin), was also the son of Anatolio and Rosario. There is no dispute that Rosario is Franklin's mother, but Juanito asserted that Franklin's father is Celedonio Salvador (Celedonio), Rosario's second husband, after Anatolio.

It is also agreed that Franklin was born after Anatolio died, though his exact birth date is disputed. The parties diverge on the date of Anatolio's death, Juanito claimed that his father died in 1942, whereas Maria asserted that he died on April 4, 1944. Maria alleged that Franklin was born on September 30, 1944, after Anatolio's death, but before Rosario's second marriage. Juanito contended that even before Anatolio's death, Rosario was already cohabiting with Celedonio, and that Franklin was the result of the cohabitation.[5]

In 1976, Juanito migrated to the United States of America. On February 16, 1977, his mother Rosario signed a Sworn Statement of the True Current and Fair Market Value of Real Properties which constituted Juanito's inheritance from Anatolio. Rosario designated herself merely as the administrator on behalf of the owner, Juanito.[6]

In 1993, Franklin registered his own birth, supplying his information and signing as the ""Informant"" in the Certificate of Live Birth. Rosario was still alive at this time but did not sign or certify that she attended the birth of Franklin. Rosario died on October 24, 1995. Franklin died on May 31, 2000, leaving behind children from different women, his surviving wife, Maria and their children, Alexis, Jeffrey, and Anthony, all surnamed Salvador.[7]

In 2001, Juanito returned to Cebu and discovered that Franklin had disposed of some of the properties Juanito inherited from Anatolio. Some properties appeared to have been sold after Franklin had already died. Also in 2001, Maria filed two Complaints for Estafa against Juanito, which were dismissed by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor. Maria filed a Petition for Review with the Department of Justice, which denied the petition.[8]

In 2005, Maria and her children Alexis, Jeffrey, and Anthony, as well as Franklin's daughter with another woman, Hyacinth, all surnamed Salvador (collectively, Maria, et al.), instituted a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Reconveyance of Property, Partition, Recovery of Possession, Quieting of Title, Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against Juanito, as well as Ken Russel Salvador and Michael Salvador, who are Franklin's sons from his first wife, (collectively, Juanito, et al.).[9] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. AV-1320 before the RTC, Branch 26, Argao, Cebu.[10]

In their Complaint[11] before the RTC, Maria, et al. alleged that Anatolio and Rosario acquired several pieces of real property, which should have been passed on to Juanito and Franklin after their parents' deaths. Maria, et al. claimed that the properties should have been transferred to them after Franklin's death, as his heirs. They presented 30 Tax Declarations pertaining to these properties. Maria, et al. assert that Juanito caused the partition, subdivision and adjudication of some of these properties, including the shares belonging to Maria, et al. as heirs of Franklin.[12]

Maria, et al. claimed that they made several attempts to ""enter the property [sic] or take possession thereof, or gather the fruits""[13] as well as oral demands against Juanito but they were prevented from the ""beneficial use, enjoyment and participation of the said property [sic][.]""[14] The Complaint did not specify which property or properties they were referring to, however, they alleged that Juanito continued to enjoy the fruits of the properties including the ""ancestral house.""[15]

In his Answer,[16] Juanito asserted that the properties claimed by Maria, et al. are the exclusive properties of Anatolio, who is not Franklin's father. He claimed that he and Franklin were raised as full-blood brothers, but he had heard from others that this was not true.[17]

In their Formal Offer of Exhibits,[18] Maria, et al. repeatedly stated that Franklin is entitled to a ""one-half share"" of these properties since he is the full-blood brother of Juanito.[19] As to the two properties registered in Franklin's name, Maria, et al. stated that Juanito was also claiming those as his own properties since these were inherited from Anatolio.[20] Juanito admitted the existence and genuineness of all the Tax Declarations, but opposed the claim that Franklin was entitled to any share.[21] As to the Tax Declarations in Franklin's name, Juanito stated that these were ""[proof] of usurpation of [Juanito's] lawful rights by [Maria, et al.]""[22] In the RTC Decision, the trial court stated that Maria sought to divide the properties placed in Juanito's name since Franklin is also a son of Anatolio.[23] It appears from the foregoing that the subject properties are part of the estate of Anatolio, which ought to be divided among his legal heirs. The parties merely disagree as to whether Franklin is an heir entitled to a share therein.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated March 30, 2017, and the Resolution,[3] dated August 25, 2017, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CV No. 05292. The CA upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Decision,[4] dated November 11, 2013, finding that Franklin Salvador (Franklin) is the legitimate child of Anatolio Salvador (Anatolio).","Juanito claims to be the only son of Anatolio and Rosario. Juanito et al. claimed before the RTC that Anatolio died in 1942, two years before Franklin was allegedly born in 1944. Maria et al., however, presented several witnesses and documentary evidence to prove that Anatolio died in 1944. Conversely, Juanito testified that he did not seek proof of his father's date of death and relied only on the word of others.[35] Both the RTC and the CA agreed that Maria, et al. had sufficiently proven that Anatolio died in 1944.

It is well established that the Court is not a trier of facts. The Court's function in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts or tribunals. It is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh evidence that have already been considered in the lower courts, especially in this case where the RTC and CA agree as to the sufficiency of the evidence presented.[36] At this stage of the proceedings, it must be beyond debate that Anatolio died on April 4, 1944.

Juanito, et al. mainly question the RTC's appreciation of Franklin's Birth Certificate, which was belatedly registered in 1993. Juanito, et al. assert that the RTC erred in admitting Franklin's Birth Certificate because the same was acquired through delayed registration and applied for by Franklin alone, without any other person attesting to his date of birth.

In the case of Baldos v. Court of Appeals, the Court explained the probative value of a delayed registration of birth:
Applications for delayed registration of birth go through a rigorous process. The books making up the civil register are considered public documents and are prima facie evidence of the truth of the facts stated there. As a public document, a registered certificate of live birth enjoys the presumption of validity. It is not for Reynaldo to prove the facts stated in his certificate of live birth, but for petitioners who are assailing the certificate to prove its alleged falsity. Petitioners miserably failed to do so. Thus, the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly denied for lack of merit the petition to cancel the late registration of Reynaldo's birth.[37] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Notably, Juanito, et al. did not object to the authenticity and due execution of Franklin's Birth Certificate before the RTC. They merely asserted that the same is ""self-serving,"" from the simple fact that Franklin caused such registration.

MAESTRADO, JR., REPRESENTED BY HIS MOTHER, NENITA MAESTRADO, TONY L. MONTANTE, ALVIN D. PAL, VENJIE PLASQUITA, FRANKIE L. SABIO, AND MARIJUL O. UNDAP, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN ROQUE METALS, INC., RESPONDENT.","This case originated from several complaints for illegal dismissal[6] filed by 35 employees against Prudential Customs Brokerage Services, Inc. (PCBSI) and SRMI. Subsequently, in a Decision[7] dated April 30, 2012, the ELA ruled that PCBSI and SRMI illegally dismissed the employees, and accordingly, ordered them to pay backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. PCBSI and SRMI appealed[8] before the NLRC, which, in a Resolution[9] dated December 28, 2012, reversed the ELA and held that the employees were employed by PCBSI only and not SRMI, who only contracted PCBSI's services. The NLRC also ordered PCBSI to reinstate the employees without backwages and without loss of seniority rights. The employees moved to reconsider, which the NLRC denied in a Resolution[10] dated April 11, 2013. Consequently, they filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA.[11]

In a Decision[12] dated July 27, 2015, the CA found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC and reinstated the ELA's Decision. Both PCBSI and SRMI moved to reconsider the CA's Decision, which the CA denied in its September 16, 2015 and October 9, 2015 Resolutions.[13] Thus, both PCBSI and SRMI lodged separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari[14] with the Court, which were both denied in a Resolution dated March 2, 2016.[15] The Court also denied with finality the PCBSI and SRMI's motions to reconsider through its August 3, 2016 Resolution[16] and ordered that an entry of judgment[17] be issued. As stated earlier, the affirmed ELA Decision held that: (a) the employees were illegally dismissed; (b) the SRMI and PCBSI share solidary liability; and (c) the employees were entitled to backwages and separation pay.

After the finality of the judgment, 12 of the original 35 employees entered into separate compromise agreements[18] with PCBSI and SRMI, namely: Leo A. Abad, Romeo Abella, Mamie Agapay, Feleciano S. Bahan, Ruel R. Bahan,[19] Angelita Cabañas, Jovilito G. Maestrado, Jr.[20] (represented by his mother, Nenita Maestrado), Tony L. Montante, Alvin D. Pal, Venjie Plasquita, Frankie L. Sabio, and Marijul O. Undap (collectively, petitioners).

In these similarly worded compromise agreements, each of the petitioners agreed to receive a settlement amount and employment with SRMI as the ""full, complete, and final satisfaction of [their] labor complaint against SRMI and PCBSI."" By signing the compromise agreement each of the petitioners also manifested ""that having received in full all [their] claims subject matter of [their labor complaint] against SRMI and PCBSI and any other claims arising from [them], [they have] no further claims, rights, or actions of whatsoever nature, whether past, present or contingent against PCBSI and their stockholders, directors, officers, authorized representatives, or [successors-in-interest].""[21]

Subsequently, all parties attended the pre-execution conference before the ELA. There, petitioners signed the compromise agreements before the ELA, who wrote a note on the final page of each of the compromise agreements stating: ""without prejudice to the outcome of the pre-execution conference/proceedings,"" the employees submitted to the ELA their motion to admit the computation of the monetary awards due them.[22] PCBSI and SRMI then filed their comment[23] to the motion, arguing that: (a) the computation must be set aside and a new one made since petitioners are no longer entitled to monetary awards because they executed compromise agreements; and, (b) SRMI should not be made solidarity liable to pay backwages and separation pay following jurisprudence, which states that if the liability is ""with punitive character, such as... backwages and separation pay because of an illegal dismissal of the contractor's employee, the liability should be solely that of the contractor in the absence of proof that the principal conspired with the contractor in the commission of illegal dismissal.""[24]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which partially granted the Resolutions[4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC ruling denied the Petition for extraordinary remedies filed by respondent San Roque Metals, Inc. (SRMI), which sought to annul the Order[5] of the Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA).","The Petition has merit.

When the Court reviews a decision of the CA in a Petition for Certiorari assailing a ruling of the NLRC, its scope of review is limited to the correctness of the CA's finding of grave abuse of discretion.[37] In labor cases, the NLRC gravely abuses its discretion when ""its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion,"" or when its ruling finds no basis in the evidence and applicable statutes and case law.[38]

As will be explained below, the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC ruling, considering that the latter is supported by substantial evidence and applicable case law.

To recall, the NLRC's invalidation of the compromise agreements is grounded on the following: (1) that the consideration of the compromise agreements is unconscionably low; and (2) that the ELA's notation created an ambiguity in the contracts, which made it doubtful that petitioners signed them with full understanding of their terms and conditions.

The NLRC held that the compromise agreements must be closely scrutinized because they are also quitclaims, which the law looks upon with disfavor. This is correct. As a rule, quitclaims executed by employees are frowned upon for being contrary to public policy,[39] and ""are largely ineffective to bar recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel.""[40]

Thus, to determine whether a quitclaim is valid, the Court has held that the following must be present: (1) the employee executes a deed of quitclaim voluntarily; (2) there is no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (3) the consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (4) the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.[41] Absent these elements, a quitclaim may be invalidated. Consequently, an invalidated quitclaim does not have the effect of res judicata between the parties.

The NLRC is correct that the considerations for these compromise agreements, even when coupled with petitioners' continued employment by SRMI, are not reasonable. As tabulated[42] by the NLRC, the amounts stated in the compromise agreements represent a small portion—ranging from 5.20% to 23.42%—of what petitioners stand to receive under the final judgment:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 30, 2019 and Resolution dated December 22, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08742-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Contrary to Art. III, Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 (The Anti-Child Abuse Act).""[3]
On arraignment, Joven pleaded not guilty to the offenses charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[4]

The prosecution presented AAA and her mother, BBB. The presentation of the following witnesses was dispensed with:
Dr. Gwendolyn Luna (Dr. Luna) of the xxxxxxxxxxx in Dagupan City, as the defense admitted her findings and the contents of the Medico-Legal Report; and
Police Officer 1 Jonabel Celso of the Philippine National Police - xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan, as the defense also admitted that the Police Certification attached to the records was a faithful reproduction of the police blotter entries.[5]
Before BBB's testimony, the defense admitted the following:
AAA was a minor being only 17 years old;
AAA's mental state as observed in her house;
AAA was impregnated but the identity of the father remains unknown since there were three alleged assailants; and
AAA gave birth to a child.[6]","When a person has sexual intercourse with a child through force, threat, or intimidation, the crime of rape is committed. A child does not have the capacity to give consent to a sexual act.

The case presents an opportunity for the Court to clearly demonstrate the application of Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act vis-à-vis Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, involving a child who is 12 years old or below 18.

This Court resolves an appeal from the June 3, 2021 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's conviction[2] of Paul Joven y Senenche (Joven) of two counts of violation of Section 5(6) of Republic Act No. 7610. The Court of Appeals modified the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Joven by convicting him instead of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

In three separate Informations, Joven was charged with three counts of other sexual abuse punished under Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. The accusatory portions of the Informations read:","The Court deems it appropriate to discuss the proper designation of the crime committed by accused-appellant given the variation in the findings of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. As correctly found and explained by the Court of Appeals, accused-appellant should be convicted of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, instead of other sexual abuse punished under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.

It is worth noting that on March 4, 2022, Republic Act No. 11648[41] was enacted, amending the Revised Penal Code, the Anti-Rape Law, and Republic Act No. 7610. The law increased the age of sexual consent from 12 years old to 16 years old. This is a welcome development as it provides stronger protection for children from rape and sexual exploitation and abuse. However, Republic Act No. 11648 is not applicable in this case, given that the crime was committed within the period of January to March 2016 prior to the law's enactment. Moreover, the case involves a victim whose age is not covered by the amendment.

Based on the Informations, the charge against accused-appellant was ""other sexual abuse,""[42] as defined in Article III, Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 as ""[t]hose who commit the act of sexual intercourse ... with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.""[43] The allegations in the Informations stated that accused-appellant ""willfully and unlawfully indulge [AAA], a seventeen (17) year old minor child ... into sexual intercourse with him due to coercion and undue influence on his part, to the prejudice and damage of the said minor child.""[44] Although the Informations stated that the acts were ""[c]ontrary to Art. III, Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 (The Anti-Child Abuse Act),""[45] it is the factual allegations in the Informations that determine the crime being charged.[46]

As the charges against accused-appellant were for other sexual abuse, we now examine whether the elements of other sexual abuse exist in this case. Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 reads:
SECTION 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

....

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.] (Emphasis supplied)
For a successful prosecution of other sexual abuse, the prosecution must establish the following elements: ""(1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;""[47] (2) ""the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution""[48] or subjected to other sexual abuse;[49] and (3) ""the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.""[50] As correctly held by the Court of Appeals, accused-appellant cannot be held liable for other sexual abuse as the second element of the crime is not present in this case.[51]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The June 3, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43909 is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Paul Joven y Senenche is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each count. Furthermore, accused-appellant shall pay AAA PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape. All amounts awarded shall earn interest at the legal rate of six percent per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment."

"A.M. No. 24-02-09-SC, May 28, 2024",RE: DRAFT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE-NATIONAL PROSECUTION SERVICE'S [DOJNPS] RULES ON PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUEST PROCEEDINGS,"In a Letter dated October 27, 2023 addressed to Undersecretary Raul T. Vasquez (Usec. Vasquez), Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo (the Chief Justice) transmitted the comments of the members of the banc to the DOJ for its consideration.

Through a Letter[2] dated January 22, 2024, Usec. Vasquez highlighted the matters adopted by the DOJ from the Court's comments in its final version of the DOJ-NPS Rules, attaching a complete copy of the same.

The Chief Justice wrote a letter[3] dated February 7, 2024 addressed to the banc, urging its members to recognize the authority of the DOJ to promulgate its DOJ-NPS Rules consistent with jurisprudence that the conduct of preliminary investigation [and inquest proceedings] is not a judicial function but part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive.[4] The Chief Justice further stated that this would entail the repeal of the affected provisions under Rule 112 of the current Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.
 
A brief history of the rules on preliminary investigation


Under the Rules of Court promulgated in 1940 (1940 Rules of Court), preliminary investigation is defined as a previous inquiry or examination made before the arrest of the defendant by the judge or officer authorized to conduct the same, with whom a complaint or information has been filed imputing the commission of an offense cognizable by the Court of First Instance, for the purpose of determining whether there is a reasonable ground to believe that an offense has been committed and the defendant is probably guilty thereof, so as to issue a warrant of arrest and to hold him for trial.[5] The 1964 version of the Rules of Court (1964 Rules of Court) essentially maintained such a definition but used the term ""preliminary examination"" instead of preliminary investigation.[6] In People v. Montilla,[7] the Court ruled that ""our statutory rules and jurisprudence required prima facie evidence, which was of a higher degree or quantum, and was even used with dubiety as equivalent to 'probable cause.'"" It noted, however, that such problems and confusing concepts were clarified by the 1985 amendment of the Rules of Court.

The 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure reve1ied to the term preliminary investigation, which it defined as an inquiry or proceeding for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime cognizable by the Regional Trial Court has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial.[8] This definition was maintained in the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure promulgated in 2000 (2000 Rules).[9] As noted in Montilla, the quantum of evidence required in preliminary investigation is such evidence as suffices to ""engender a well-founded belief' as to the fact of the commission of a crime and the respondent's probable guilt thereof. ","The Court's Sub-Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure (Sub-Committee),[1] received from one of its members from the Department of Justice (DOJ), a copy of the draft DOJ Circular on the proposed Rules on Preliminary Investigation and Inquest Proceeding in the National Prosecution Service (DOJ-NPS Rules). Coincidentally, the Court's rules on Preliminary Investigation (Rule 112) are among those to be revised under the Proposed Rules on Criminal Procedure. Thus, to ensure harmony between the DOJ's conduct of preliminary investigations or inquest proceedings and our existing court procedures, the Sub-Committee solicited comments from the members of the banc.","Per the 1940 Rules of Court, every justice of the peace, municipal judge or city fiscal shall have jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation of all offenses alleged to have been committed within his municipality or city, cognizable by the Court of First Instance.[22] The same is true under the 1964 Rules of Court, with the addition of the authorized officer's provincial jurisdiction.[23] In the 2000 Rules, preliminary investigation is required to be conducted for offenses where the penalty prescribed by law is at least four years, two months, and one day without regard to the fine.[24] This was retained under the amended rules in 2005.[25]
 
Authority of the DOJ to promulgate its own rules and its repercussions on Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules
 

As illustrated above, preliminary investigation, as a vehicle to determine whether a person should be indicted, used to be a function shared by judges and prosecutors. The paradigm, however, shifted to one of exclusivity in favor of public prosecutors. As early as 1986 in Salta v. Court of Appeals,[26] the Court has held that the conduct of preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial function. Thus:
A preliminary investigation is intended to protect the accused from the inconvenience, expense, and burden of defending himself in a formal trial until the reasonable probability of his guilt has first been ascertained in a fairly summary proceeding by a competent officer. It is also intended to protect the State from having to conduct useless and expensive trials. Section 1, Rule 112 of the present Rules of Court states that it is conducted for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime cognizable by the court has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial. The preliminary investigation pm per is, therefore, not a judicial function. It is a part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive.[27] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)
This pronouncement was reiterated m the 1997 case of People v. Navarro,[28] where the Court has held:
It must be stressed that preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial, function. As the officer authorized to direct and control the prosecution of all criminal actions, a prosecutor is primarily responsible for ascertaining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.[29]
By reason of this shift in the nature of preliminary investigation, the Court has adopted a policy of non-interference in the public prosecutor's conduct thereof.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court hereby RECOGNIZES the AUTHORITY of the Department of Justice to promulgate its 2024 DOJ­ National Prosecution Service Rules on Preliminary Investigations and Inquest Proceedings (2024 DOJ-NPS Rules).

Thereafter, and once the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules are promulgated by the DOJ, the pertinent provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, inconsistent therewith are deemed REPEALED. This shall be without prejudice to the Court's promulgation of its own rules of procedure, of a new rule touching upon preliminary investigation, consistent with the 2024 DOJ- NPS Rules.

Let a copy of the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules be endorsed to the Sub­ Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for its guidance and appropriate action."
"G.R. No. 258510, May 28, 2024","JESS CHRISTOPHER S. BIONG, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in August 2010, the Comptrollership/Accounting Unit of PhilHealth Region III found that there were no inspection and acceptance reports (IARs) on the deliveries. Hence, the payments due to Silicon Valley were withheld by PhilHealth Region III.[8]

Thereafter, Rodolfo M. Balog (Balog), Vice President of PhilHealth Region III, consulted Trinidad Gozun (Gozun), State Auditor IV and Audit Team Leader of PhilHealth Region III, who suggested that in lieu of IARs, alternative documents may be attached to the disbursement voucher (DV).

Accordingly, PhilHealth Region III attached the following documents: (1) Certification from the General Services Unit (GSU) issued by petitioner Biong, as the Head of the GSU, that the supplies were delivered; (2) Supplies Withdrawal Slips (SWSs) which contained the items requisitioned by the end-users; and (3) Monthly Report of Supplies and Materials Inventory (MRSMI) prepared by the GSU to support the journal entry voucher of the Comptrollership/Accounting Unit.[9]

After evaluation of the documents, PhilHealth Region III processed and released the Philippine Veterans Bank Check Nos. 5227 (PHP 117,207.95) and 5226 (PHP 373,094.20), both dated December 22, 2010, and Check- Nos. 5274 (PHP 398,934.59) and 5273 (PHP 216,962.78), both dated December 30, 2010, to Silicon Valley.[10]

A month after, or on January 31, 2011, petitioner Biong discovered incidents of theft of office supplies and falsification of SWSs in the GSU office.[11]

In an Incident Report[12] dated February 22, 2011, petitioner Biong revealed that inks and toners delivered by Masangkay Computer Center on January 20, 2011, and January 24, 2011, respectively, and inks delivered by PC Worx on January 28, 2011, were declared missing on January 31, 2011. In the same report, petitioner Biong recommended that an official and more thorough investigation be conducted by the PhilHealth Legal Office on the alleged loss of office supplies and expressed the willingness of GSU personnel to cooperate with the investigation.[13]

According to petitioner Biong, he was informed by Susan David (David) and Mary Joy Cruz (Cruz), the personnel in charge of inventories and issuances, that some of the inks and toners which were delivered by PC Worx on January 28, 2011, and were stored inside the GSU Office were missing.[14] Consequently, they held a meeting on February 19, 2011, at the Managements Services Division (MSD) Office to clarify the sequence of events that transpired. Thereafter, they requested David, Cruz, and Jenalyn Deang to submit their respective statements relative to their personal knowledge of the alleged theft of office supplies.[15]

In her statement, Cruz accused Jajomar Marbebe (Marbebe), who at that time was a project-based employee, of routinely bringing inks out of the office.[16] When confronted, however, Marbebe denied Cruz's allegations. He explained that he had other sources of income which allowed him to obtain loans to purchase houses and a motorcycle and put up a sari-sari store.[17] Thereafter, his contract was no longer renewed on March 17, 2011.[18]

On March 18, 2011, petitioner Biong wrote a letter to signify his intention to file a request for a relief of accountability in connection with the missing office supplies and a Request for Relief from Accountability from Loss of Property[19] with the COA Audit Team.[20] However, it does not appear from the records whether an audit decision had been issued on petitioner Biong's request for relief of accountability.

Thereafter, the COA Audit Team issued the subject NDs to officers of PhilHealth Region III, including Biong, on the purchases of printer inks and toners of PhilHealth Region III from Silicon Valley.

The subject matter of ND No. 11-002-000(10) dated July 5, 2011, was PO No. 09-236 dated December 4, 2009.[21] On the other hand, ND No. 11-003-000(20) dated August 15, 2011, pertained to (i) PO No. 043 dated April 25, 2008, (ii) PO No. 160 dated November 4, 2008, and (iii) PO No. 09-005 dated February 4, 2009.[22]","This resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Jess Christopher S. Biong (petitioner Biong) assailing Decision No. 2019-040[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA). In the assailed Decision, the COA approved with modification the Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 11-002-000-(10)[3] dated July 5, 2011, ND No. 11-003-000(10)[4] dated August 15, 2011, and COA RO3 Decision No. 2012-46.[5]

The disallowed amounts pertain to payments made by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) Region III to Silicon Valley, with office at SM Pampanga, San Jose, City of San Fernando, Pampanga,[6] for office supplies, particularly printer inks and toners, purchased under Purchase Order (PO) No. 09-236 dated December 4, 2009, PO No. 043 dated April 25, 2008, PO No. 160 dated November 4, 2008, and PO No. 09-005 dated February 4, 2009.[7]","The petition is meritorious.

At the outset, it is worth noting that the COA did not dispute Biong's contention that he was not served a copy of Decision No. 2019-040 dated March 21, 2019,[74] before the COA issued the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252.

Evidently, there was an invalid service of the COA's Decision to petitioner Biong. As a result, petitioner Biong was deprived of his right to due process: he was not given the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration because, by the time he secured a copy of the assailed Decision, the COA had already issued the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252.[75]

On this score alone, the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252 should be set aside. The failure of the COA to serve a copy of its decision to petitioner Biong is in clear violation of Section 7 of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit which states:
SECTION 7. Service of Copies of ND/NC/NS, Order or Decision. — The ND, NC, NS, order, or decision shall be served to each of the persons liable/responsible by the Auditor, through personal service, or if not practicable through registered mail ... (Italics supplied.)
The COA's failure to abide by their own rules of procedure is tantamount to grave abuse of discretion.

On the merits of the case, the Court likewise finds for petitioner Biong.

As a rule, the COA's findings of fact are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence because of their presumed expertise over matters falling under their jurisdiction.[76] Nonetheless, the Court will not hesitate to exercise its expanded power of judicial review under the second paragraph[77] of Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution upon a showing that the COA's decision is tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[78]

In De Castro v. Commission on Audit,[79] the Court held that ""the power of COA to disallow expenditures proceeds from its duty to prevent irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant expenditures or uses of government funds or property, and those which are illegal and unconscionable.""[80] Thus, in the absence of any finding that an expenditure falls under any of these anomalous types on disbursements, a disallowance is unwarranted.[81]

Here, the disallowance was based on the COA' s finding that the payments made to Silicon Valley were irregular expenditures.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The assailed Commission on Audit Decision No. 2019-040 dated March 21, 2019, and Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252 dated November 17, 2021, are SET ASIDE."
"G.R. No. 264196, May 28, 2024","ROBINSONS APPLIANCES CORPORATION (ROBINSONS FORUM), PETITIONER, VS. HON. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, HON. UNDERSECRETARY ROWEL S. BARBA AND DTI-FAIR TRADE ENFORCEMENT BUREAU-ENFORCEMENT DIVISION RESPONDENTS.","Robinsons Appliances Corporation is a domestic corporation that owns and operates Robinsons Appliances, Robinsons Forum branch located in Mandaluyong City, the store subject of this case.[8]

On January 29, 2016, pursuant to Bureau Order Nos. 16-09, 16-10, 16-11 and 16-12, Series of 2016, the DTI-FTEB conducted an inspection and investigation on the business premises of Robinsons Appliances. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the store's compliance with the Mandatory Philippine National Standard (PNS) pursuant to Republic Act No. 4109, or An Act to Convert the Division of Standards Under the Bureau of Commerce into a Bureau of Standards, to Provide for the Standardization and/or Inspection of Products and Imports of the Philippines and for Other Purposes.[9]

In the course of its inspection, the DTI-FTEB discovered 15 sets of flat iron bearing the Hanabishi brand for sale at Robinsons Appliances with the Philippine Standard (PS) Mark but without the required PS License Number.[10] As a result, a Formal Charge with Prayer for the Issuance of a Preventive Measure Order[11] was filed against Robinsons Appliances before the DTI-­FTEB Adjudication Division for violation of Sections 3.5,[12] 5.1,[13] 6.1.1[14] and 6.2.1[15] of DAO No. 2-2007, in relation to Section 4, DAO No. 4, Series of 2008 (DAO No. 4-2008) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), in relation to PNS 254-1:1994 Amd. 01:2000, pursuant to Republic Act No. 4109.[16]

In its Answer,[17] Robinsons Appliances countered that the products subject of the formal charge were merely supplied to it under a consignment agreement with Fortune Buddies Corporation (Fortune Buddies), which is the manufacturer and/or principal distributor of the 15 Hanabishi flat irons. It averred that Fortune Buddies is solely responsible for ensuring that its products comply with the PNS on the required markings. Robinsons Appliances also questioned the authority of the DTI-FTEB in conducting the inspection and investigation.[18]

After due proceedings, the DTI-FTEB Adjudication Division rendered a Decision[19] with the following dispositive portion:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Office rules in favor of the Complainant. Judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondent to pay the total amount of Twenty[-]Five Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 25,000.00) as fine for violation of Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2 Series of 2007 at the Cashier's Office, Ground Floor UPRC Building, 315 Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City upon finality of this Decision and the subject products are deemed FORFEITED in favor of the government for safekeeping until its eventual disposal.

The decision of this Office shall serve as a warning for a more severe penalty to be imposed should a similar violation is committed by the same respondent.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Robinsons Appliances Corporation, Robinsons Forum Branch (Robinsons Appliances), seeking the reversal of the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari[4] filed by Robinsons Appliances that assailed the Decision[5] of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Office of the Secretary (DTI Secretary), which affirmed the Decision[6] of the DTI Fair Trade and Enforcement Bureau (DTI-­FTEB). The DTI-FTEB found Robinsons Appliances liable for violating Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 2007 (DAO No.2-2007). Accordingly, the DTI-FTEB imposed a fine of PHP 25,000.00 against Robinsons Appliances and ordered the forfeiture of 15 sets of Hanabishi flat iron being sold by Robinsons Appliances in favor of the government.[7]","The Petition should be denied for lack of merit.
 
The CA properly dismissed the Petition for Certiorari for being the wrong remedy and for its belated filing
 

It is settled that the special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is intended to correct errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[41] Section 1 mandates that a Rule 65 petition may only be resorted to when there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. While Our ruling in Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals[42] recognized exceptions to the general rule that a petition for certiorari would not prosper if there existed a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, none of the enumerated exceptions[43] are present in this case.

Here, Robinsons Appliances could have filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court to appeal the judgment of the DTI. Section 1 of Rule 43 provides the remedy of an appeal from the judgment or order of a quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, such as the DTI. Due to the availability of the remedy of an appeal via Rule 43, this Court agrees with the CA that the filing of a Petition for Certiorari to assail the DTI Secretary's Decision was the wrong remedy.

Robinsons Appliances argues that the ruling of the DTI Secretary is appealable via a petition for certiorari before the proper court, citing Article 166 of Republic Act No. 7394. According to Robinsons Appliances, Article 166, which provides that the decision of the DTI Secretary becomes final 15 days from receipt unless a petition for certiorari is filed with the proper court, does not distinguish between administrative cases initiated by a consumer and those initiated by the DTI or its offices motu proprio. Thus, as the instant case was initiated by the DTI-FTEB, it still falls within the ambit of Article 166, contrary to the CA's ruling.[44]

The argument fails to impress.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated February 15, 2021 and the Resolution dated October 19, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157330 are AFFIRMED. Robinsons Appliances Corporation, Robinsons Forum Branch is liable to PAY PHP 25,000.00 as fine for its violation of Sections 5.1, 6.1.1, and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2, series of 2007, and Section 4 of Department Administrative Order No. 4, series of 2008, in relation to Section 4 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The 15 sets of Hanabishi flat irons are deemed FORFEITED in favor of the government for safekeeping until its eventual disposal."
"A.C. No. 13628, May 28, 2024 ","HELEN A. PAEZ, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. ALFONSO D. DEBUQUE, RESPONDENT.","The records evince that the parties executed three deeds of sale with varying terms and conditions. The ""Deed of Absolute Sale with Assignment of Mortgage""[5] (first deed of sale) stated that the total consideration for the subject realty was PHP 500,000.00, where PHP 300,000.00 was to be paid to the Rural Bank to cover Paez's mortgage loan and the remaining PHP 200,000.00 was to be paid to her.[6]

The ""Deed of Absolute Sale""[7] (second deed of sale) stated that the purchase price was PHP 300,000.00, which was to be paid solely to Paez. Moreover, she was to pay the capital gains tax, documentary stamp tax, transfer tax, and the current real property tax.[8]

Paez later executed the ""Deed of Absolute Sale""[9] (third deed of sale), with only her signature affixed. The terms stipulated in this document were the same as in the second deed of sale anent the PHP 300,000.00 purchase price, as well as the payment of taxes to be shouldered by her.[10]

Hereupon, the narratives of the parties diverged.

Paez asserted that under the first deed of sale where the consideration for the realty was PHP 500,000.00, the amount of PHP 300,000.00 was to be paid to the Rural Bank, while the remaining PHP 200,000.00 was to be paid to her. This consideration was later reduced to PHP 300,000.00 and made payable solely to her.[11]

Since Paez was then detained at the Pasay City Jail, she appointed her sister, Raylene Paez-Rezano (Rezano) as her attorney-in-fact for her dealings regarding the sale of the subject realty.[12] Atty. Debuque agreed to pay the remaining balance but failed to do so.[13] He requested Paez to prepare a deed of sale, purportedly so that he could send the full payment.[14] Thereupon, Paez caused the preparation of the third deed of sale, which she signed and sent to Atty. Debuque.[15] Still and all, he failed to pay the full purchase price and Paez never received any payment from him throughout the duration of her incarceration.

Upon her release from detention, Paez discovered the existence of the first deed of sale from the Rural Bank, which was supposedly signed by her and Atty. Debuque. Pursuant to such document, she no longer had any interest in the subject realty. This impelled Paez to confront Atty. Debuque, but he denied the existence of the first deed of sale. Instead, he showed her the second deed of sale between Paez and Rezano. Atty. Debuque, however, refused to pay the remaining balance, claiming that he no longer owed Paez any amount.[16]

On the other hand, Atty. Debuque insisted that he already paid the remaining balance by way of installment, which he handed to Rezano.[17]

The records disclose that Atty. Debuque filed two Answers on two different dates, i.e., November 29, 2012[18] and May 22, 2013.[19]

In his Answer dated November 29, 2012, Atty. Debuque claimed having paid the total price of PHP 250,000.00.[20] He also admitted that he advised Rezano to prepare another deed of absolute sale, which was intended to avoid penalties on the unpaid taxes. He also agreed to pay for its notarization.[21] On the other hand, in his Answer dated May 22, 2013, he averred that he ""had already paid completely in [installment] basis until the year 2009 the total consideration of. . . [PHP] 300,000.00.""[22]

Later on, Atty. Debuque avowed in his Reply and Comment to Position Paper of the Complainant[23] dated November 29, 2013 that he had no knowledge of the execution of the third deed of sale, which reflected the consideration worth PHP 300,000.00. He maintained that Paez executed the third deed of sale to evade the taxes and other fees which she undertook to pay.[24]

Yet again, in his Position Paper,[25] Atty. Debuque stated that the remaining balance was PHP 200,000.00, out of which, PHP 171,430.00 was already paid in installments. The only remaining balance was PHP 28,870.00.[26]

During the two mandatory conferences, only Paez appeared.[27]","Before this Court is a Verified Complaint[1] filed by petitioner Helen A. Paez (Paez) against respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque (Atty. Debuque) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)[2] and the Lawyer's Oath.
At the vortex of the instant controversy is an 800-square-meter lot covered under Transfer Certificate Title No. T-210051 in Barangay Pagduque, Dumangas, Iloilo (subject realty).[3] The disputatious subject realty was mortgaged to the Rural Bank of Dumangas (Rural Bank) for Paez's loan worth PHP 300,000.00 and in danger of being foreclosed. Since Paez was then incarcerated, she decided to sell the property to Atty. Debuque. Part of their agreement was that he would first pay her loan with the Rural Bank.[4]","After a judicious study of the case, the Court finds that the actuations of Atty. Debuque constitute a violation of the CPRA.

On April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc approved the CPRA.[35] As an institutional imperative, the CPRA is meant to foster an environment where ethical conduct performs a dedicated role in the administration of justice. In particular, the standards embodied in the CPRA uniquely address the characteristics of the Filipino lawyer as an amalgamation of influences and moorings, i.e., familial, cultural, religious, academic, political, and philosophical. Inherently a social being, the Filipino lawyer inevitably develops and cultivates relations, preferences, and biases. The conscious adoption of ethical standards that accounts for such relationships and personal choices balanced against the demands of right and justice is envisioned to govern and regulate these personal choices and make them consistent with the institutional objectives.[36]

The canons of the CPRA are rules that lawyers must adhere to, including the manner in which a lawyer must conduct themselves.

Under its General Provisions, the CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.[37]

In the case at bench, the Court finds and so rules that the CPRA applies.

Atty. Debuque was found liable for violation of Canon I, Rule 1.01 of the CPR. This provision is reiterated in the CPRA under Canon II, Section 1, which states:

SECTION 1. Proper conduct. — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct[.]

Be that as it may, the Court still finds Atty. Debuque to have flouted the following provisions of Canon II, Sections 2, 5 and 11 of the CPRA, viz.:

SECTION 2. Dignified conduct. — A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar.

. . . .

SECTION 5. Observance of fairness and obedience. — A lawyer shall, in every personal and professional engagement, insist on the observance of the principles of fairness and obedience to the law.

. . . .

SECTION 11. False representations or statements; duty to correct. — A lawyer shall not make false representations or statements. A lawyer shall be liable for any material damage caused by such false representations or statements.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque is declared GUILTY of violation of Canon II, Section 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three years effective immediately from receipt of this Decision with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of any of the offenses involved in this case or a commission of similar acts will merit a more severe penalty. Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque is also DIRECTED to INFORM this Court of the date of his receipt of this Decision to determine the reckoning point of the effectivity of his suspension.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for their information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all the courts in the country."
"G.R. No. 223845, May 28, 2024","JOSELLER M. GUIAO, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE AMUSEMENT AND GAMING CORPORATION, PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, RESPONDENTS.","On April 26, 2016, Guiao, then a member of the House of Representatives and Vice Chairperson of the House Committee on Youth and Sports Development, filed a Petition for Mandamus before this Court against the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, and Office of the President, alleging that they failed in their duty to comply with the funding requirements in Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847, otherwise known as the Philippine Sports Commission Act.[3] The pertinent portion of Section 26 as cited by Guiao provides:

SECTION 26. Funding. — . . . .

To finance the country's integrated sports development program, including the holding of the national games and all other sports competitions at all levels throughout the country as well as the country's participation at international sports competitions, such as, but not limited to, the Olympic, Asian, and Southeast Asian Games, and all other international competitions, sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and the International Federations, thirty percent (30%) representing the charity fund of the proceeds of six (6) sweepstakes of lottery draws per annum, taxes on horse races during special holidays, five percent (5%) of the gross income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, the proceeds from the sale of stamps as hereinafter provided, and three percent (3%) of all taxes collected on imported athletic equipment shall be automatically remitted directly to the Commission and are hereby constituted as the National Sports Development Fund. Further, the Philippine Postal Service Office is hereby authorized to print paper and gold stamps which shall depict sports events and such other motif as the Philippine Postal Service Office may decide, at the expense of the Commission. Any deficiency in the financial requirements of the Commission for its sports development program shall be covered by an annual appropriation passed by Congress.[4] (Emphasis supplied)

Guiao claimed that the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation committed grave abuse of discretion when it failed to remit 5% of its gross income to the Philippine Sports Commission for the National Sports Development Fund, as mandated in Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847.[5]

In support of his allegations, Guiao attached a Memorandum[6] dated November 5, 1993 addressed to then President Fidel V. Ramos, issued by his Executive Secretary, which sought the President's approval of the percentage allocations made by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation as to its income, as follows:

 	Prior	Proposed
BIR Franchise Tax	5.0%	5.0%
NG Share	45.12%	47.5%
NPC Subsidy	-	4.75%
PSC Share	4.75%	4.51%
PAGCOR	45.13%	38.24%
Total	100%	100%
Guiao alleged that such recommendation by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation was approved by the President in a Memorandum dated November 10, 1993.[7] Thereafter, in another Memorandum dated February 20, 1995, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation again recommended to the President the following allocation of its earnings:[8]","For the extraordinary writ of mandamus to issue, there must be a showing of a clear legal right demandable by petitioner and a correlative legal duty to perform an act on the part of respondent.
Before this Court is a Petition for Mandamus[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Joseller M. Guiao (Guiao), seeking to compel the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, and Office of the President to remit funds to the Philippine Sports Commission, as provided under Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847.[2]","Based on the foregoing, we rule that petitioner has legal standing to file this Petition in his capacity as legislator.

In any case, this Court has, on occasion, relaxed the rules on standing when the issues involved are of transcendental importance, or those that are so important so as to be imbued with paramount public interest.[67] Leeway is given to petitions filed by parties who have no personal or substantial interest in the challenged governmental act but nonetheless raise ""constitutional issue[s] of critical significance.""[68] This was demonstrated in Kilusang Mayo Uno Labor Center v. Hon. Garcia, Jr.,[69] in this wise:

Assuming arguendo that petitioner is not possessed of the standing to sue, this court is ready to brush aside this barren procedural infirmity and recognize the legal standing of the petitioner in view of the transcendental importance of the issues raised. And this act of liberality is not without judicial precedent. As early as the Emergency Powers Cases, this Court had exercised its discretion and waived the requirement of proper party.[70]

This was likewise demonstrated in Agan, Jr. v. Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc.,[71] thus:

Standing is a peculiar concept in constitutional law because in some cases, suits are not brought by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or any other government act but by concerned citizens, taxpayers or voters who actually sue in the public interest. Although we are not unmindful of the cases of Imus Electric Co. v. Municipality of Imus and Gonzales v. Raquiza wherein this Court held that appropriation must be made only on amounts immediately demandable, public interest demands that we take a more liberal view in determining whether the petitioners suing as legislators, taxpayers and citizens have locus standi to file the instant petition. In Kilosbayan, Inc. v. Guingona, this Court held ""[i]n line with the liberal policy of this Court on locus standi, ordinary taxpayers, members of Congress, and even association of planters, and non-profit civic organizations were allowed to initiate and prosecute actions before this Court to question the constitutionality or validity of laws, acts, decisions, rulings, or orders of various government agencies or instrumentalities."" Further, ""insofar as taxpayers' suits are concerned . . . (this Court) is not devoid of discretion as to whether or not it should be entertained."" As such"". . . even if, strictly speaking, they [the petitioners] are not covered by the definition, it is still within the wide discretion of the Court to waive the requirement and so remove the impediment to its addressing and resolving the serious constitutional questions raised."" In view of the serious legal questions involved and their impact on public interest, we resolve to grant standing to the petitioners.[72] (Citations omitted)

Verily, this Court has time and again relaxed the rules of procedure to advance substantial justice.[73] The allegations of manifest contravention of the legal funding of the Philippine Sports Commission, the premier government agency responsible for the development and advancement of the nation's sports program, is a constitutionally significant issue that deserves this Court's attention.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Mandamus is GRANTED. The Memoranda dated November 5, 1993 and February 20, 1995 of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation is hereby deemed VOID for being in contravention of Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation is ORDERED to account and remit the full amount of 5% of its gross income per annum from 1993 to present in favor of the Philippine Sports Commission.

Moreover, respondent Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office is ORDERED to account and remit to the Philippine Sports Commission the 30% representing the charity fund of the proceeds of six sweepstakes or lottery draw per annum, including its lotto draws, for the years 2006 to present."
"A.M. No. P-23-105 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-4848-P), May 28, 2024","ATTY. BONIFACIO A. ALENTAJAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. REYNER S. DE JESUS, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 109, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, PASAY CITY, RESPONDENT.","Atty. Alentajan alleged that following the ruling in Roxas v. Republic Real Estate Corporation,[2] and the consequent remand of Civil Case No. 2229-P to the RTC for execution proceedings, he filed on January 24, 2017 an Amended Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution, which the RTC granted. In the Alias Writ of Execution[3] dated September 15, 2017 (subject writ), the RTC directed De Jesus as follows:

NOW THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to cause the implementation of the decision of this Court as modified by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court upon the plaintiff thru the Commission on Audit pursuant to COA Circular No. 2001-002.

In case sufficient personal properties of the plaintiff cannot be found to satisfy the amount of the said judgment, costs, interest[,] and your fees thereon, then you are hereby directed to levy the real property/ies of the said plaintiff and to sell the same or so much thereof in the manner provided for by law for the satisfaction of the said judgment and make a return of this writ with your proceedings indorsed thereon within sixty (60) days from receipt hereof.[4]

Atty. Alentajan then intimated that sometime in May 2018, De Jesus collected from him the amount of PHP 35,000.00 purportedly for the publication and posting of the notice of auction sale. However, as of the date of the Letter-Complaint, De Jesus has yet to cause the execution of the subject writ; and worse, he could no longer be located.[5]

In his Comment,[6] De Jesus denied the accusations against him. He maintained that sometime in May 2018, he was just informed by a staff of the RTC that Atty. Alentajan left an envelope for him containing cash in the amount of PHP 32,000.00 (and not PHP 35,000.00 as alleged by Atty. Alentajan), purportedly for the payment of the publication of the auction sale. De Jesus claimed that sometime in the first week of June 2018, he chanced upon Atty. Alentajan within the court premises and told him that: (a) he (De Jesus) has yet to receive a copy of the subject writ, and that once he does, the same will still be served to the Commission on Audit (COA); and (b) Atty. Alentajan should just get back the envelope pending the foregoing. However, Atty. Alentajan got mad at him and threatened him. Further, he pointed out that the adverse party is questioning Atty. Alentajan's personality to appear in Civil Case No. 2229-P, and hence, this issue must be resolved first before he could act on the subject writ. In light of these, he claimed that the complaint against him is premature and bereft of merit.[7]","This administrative matter arose from a Letter-Complaint[1] dated June 25, 2018 and received by the Court on July 20, 2018 filed by complainant Atty. Bonifacio A. Alentajan (Atty. Alentajan), praying, inter alia, that respondent Reyner S. De Jesus (De Jesus), Sheriff IV of Branch 109, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasay City be dismissed from the service.","The Court adopts with modifications the findings and recommendations of the JIB, as will be explained hereunder.

Gross Neglect of Duty.

Gross Neglect of Duty is considered as a serious charge under Section 14(d) of Rule 140, as further amended. In Son v. Leyva,[20] the Court explained that ""[g]ross neglect of duty or gross negligence 'refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property.' It denotes a flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty. In cases involving public officials, gross negligence occurs when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.""[21]

As applied to sheriffs, such as respondent in this case, it must be stressed they ""play an important role in the administration of justice. They are tasked to execute final judgments of the courts. If not enforced, such decisions become empty victories of the prevailing parties. As agents of the law, sheriffs are called upon to discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the court's writs and processes and implementing its orders, they cannot afford to err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient administration of justice.""[22] Further, they ""ought to know that they have a sworn responsibility to serve writs of execution with utmost dispatch. When writs are placed in their hands, it is their ministerial duty to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute them in accordance with their mandate. Unless restrained by a court order, they should see to it that the execution of judgments is not unduly delayed. Accordingly, they must comply with their mandated ministerial duty as speedily as possible. As agents of the law, high standards are expected of sheriffs.""[23]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Reyner S. De Jesus, Sheriff IV, Branch 109, Regional Trial Court, Pasay City, GUILTY of gross neglect of duty; violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure, or protocol; and simple misconduct. He is meted with the following penalties:

(a)
For gross neglect of duty, respondent is meted with the penalty of FINE of PHP 210,000.00;
 	 
(b)
For violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure, or protocol, respondent is meted with a FINE of PHP 110,000.00; and
 	 
(c)
For simple misconduct, respondent is meted with a FINE of PHP 110,000.00."
"G.R. No. 267946, May 27, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NELL JACKEL TUAZON Y PANLAQUI, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Under Information dated September 2, 2016, Nell was charged with trafficking of persons committed against 16-year-old AAA viz.:
That on or about the 19th day of August 2016, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously engage the services of [AAA], a sixteen (16) year old minor, a trafficked person for prostitution through sex peddler for and in consideration of P[HP] 4,500.00 to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].

Contrary to law.[5]
The case was raffled to xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx. On arraignment, Nell pleaded not guilty.[6]

AAA and Police Officer 1 Joseneal Leaño (PO1 Joseneal) of xxxxxxxxxxx Police Station testified for the prosecution.

AAA testified that she was born on February 25, 2000, as evidenced by her birth certificate and she was 16 years old at the time of the incident.[7] On August 18, 2016, she and her friends went to a birthday celebration of one Jamaica Martin in xxxxxxxxxxx City. After the party or around 12 a.m. of August 19, 2016, she and her friends went to xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx to eat porridge.[8] Then she received text message from a certain ""Mamu Respito"" (Mamu) whom she met in 2016 during a volleyball game. Mamu asked her to see her on Acacia Lane to meet with their friends from the volleyball league.[9] AAA agreed and told Mamu to wait for her because she would have to change her clothes first.[10]

When she arrived at Acacia Lane, she saw Mamu standing in front of a green car. Mamu then instructed her to get inside the car; both of them boarded and took the rear seat. Minutes later, Mamu disembarked and a woman named ""Lian"" went inside the car and sat beside her.[11] Thereafter, two men came in. One of them was Nell who took the driver's seat, while the other man took the passenger's seat. Nell locked the doors and drove to xxxxxxxxxxx Hotel xxxxxxxxxxx on xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx City.[12] AAA was nervous, but she kept silent. On their way, she immediately texted Mamu to ask where the car was headed. Mamu replied that she would have to xxxxxxxxxxx wait for their friends in xxxxxxxxxxx.[13]

Around 2:45 a.m. of August 19, 2016, they arrived at xxxxxxxxxxx. Nell talked with a male service crew and handed him money.[14] Thereafter, AAA, Lian, Nell, and the other man went inside xxxxxxxxxxx and proceeded to Room 12A.[15] There was no one in the room, contrary to Mamu's promise that their volleyball friends were there. AAA thus suspected that she was already sold by Mamu to Nell for sexual pleasure. Nell himself also disclosed that he paid Mamu PHP 5,000.00.[16] Moments later, Lian and the other man stepped out of the room, leaving her alone with Nell. She immediately went inside the comfort room as she was worried what Nell might do. As soon as she went out the comfort room, she saw Nell naked in the bed.[17] Nell then stood, laid her on the bed, kissed her on the neck and breasts, inserted his finger, and then his penis into her vagina. AAA was crying the whole time and resisted, but to no avail.[18] Fortunately, a service crew rang the doorbell, so she took the opportunity to get away from him. She went to the comfort room again and locked the door.[19] She texted one Jommel Mulacruz (Jommel) and asked the latter to get her out of the hotel room.[20] When she came out from the comfort room, Nell continued kissing and molesting her.[21] Thereafter, the doorbell rang again; this time, it was the hotel manager who informed Nell that several police officers were waiting outside xxxxxxxxxxx.[22] The manager told her to leave the room, while a service crew showed her the way out. She went outside xxxxxxxxxxx and was comforted by Jommel and several police officers. One police officer stayed with her while the others went to Room 12A where Nell was.[23] When the police officers came out with Nell, she pointed him out to the police officers and identified him as the man who abused her inside the hotel room.[24]

Meanwhile, PO1 Joseneal testified that on August 19, 2016, he was assigned as beat patroller in the area around xxxxxxxxxxx.[25] By 2:45 a.m., a person later identified as Jommel approached and told him that AAA was brought to xxxxxxxxxxx by a certain man. PO1 Joseneal, together with PO1 Rowel Concha (PO1 Rowel), and PO1 Peter Belingon, Jr. (PO1 Peter), went to xxxxxxxxxxx and told the crew that they received a report involving a minor who was brought to xxxxxxxxxxx.[26] PO1 Joseneal, accompanied by a crew, proceeded to Room 12A and he saw Nell. On their way out, they saw AAA who was crying. Thereafter, PO1 Joseneal asked AAA who was with her in Room 12A; She pointed Nell. Thereafter, PO1 Joseneal then brought AAA, Nel, and Jommel to the Women and Children Protection Desk of xxxxxxxxxxx City Police Station.[27] Together with PO1 Rowel, and PO1 Peter, they executed their joint affidavit.[28]

The parties stipulated on the proposed testimonies of PO1 Rowel and PO1 Peter that they were among the arresting officers who apprehended Nell on August 19, 2016; testimony of Police Officer 2 Stacy Mae Clores that she assisted in taking the respective statements of AAA, PO1 Joseneal, PO1 Rowel, and PO1 Peter;[29] and of Dr. Ian Paolo Virtucio that he examined AAA and per his Medico-Legal Report No. R-004-16E dated August 19, 2016, AAA had deep healed lacerations at 3, 5, 8, & 9 o'clock positions.[30]","This Appeal seeks to reverse the following disposition of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44345 titled ""People of the Philippines v. Nell Jackel Tuazon y Panlaqui.""

The Court of Appeals sentenced Nell to reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua or 17 years to 40 years of imprisonment. He was further ordered to pay a fine of PHP 500,000.00;[3] and

2) Resolution[4] dated November 22, 2022, denying accused-appellant, Nell's motion for reconsideration.","Nell is guilty of qualified trafficking.

Republic Act No. 9208, Section 3(a), as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, defines ""Trafficking in Persons"" as:
. . . recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.[54]
Section 4(a), of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, further enumerates the acts that fall under the term ""trafficking"" in persons, thus:
(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation.[55]
Brozoto v. People[56] ordained that ""[t]he gravamen of the crime of trafficking is 'the act of recruiting or using, with or without consent, a fellow human being for [inter alia,] sexual exploitation."" Brozoto further elucidated:
Human beings are not chattels whose sexual favors are bought or sold by greedy pimps. Those who profit in this way by recruiting minors are rightfully, by law, labeled as criminals. They should be the subject of aggressive law enforcement, prosecuted, tried, and when proof beyond reasonable doubt exists, punished.[57] (Emphasis supplied)
Further, People v. Casio[58] enumerated the elements of trafficking under the expanded definition of Republic Act No. 10364, the amendatory law, thus:
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national border["";]


(2)
The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""[;] [and]


(3)
The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs[.][59]
Meanwhile, Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, states that the crime is deemed qualified when the victim is a ""child."" A ""child"" is ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.""[60]

The offense was committed on August 19, 2016. Thus, the provisions of Republic Act No. 10364, which was approved on February 6, 2013, and amended Republic Act No. 9208, are applicable.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated November 22, 2021 and Resolution dated November 22, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44345 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS.

"G.R. No. 215035, May 27, 2024","JULIETA F. ENRIQUEZ, ROMEO F. ENRIQUEZ, AND TITA E. VELASCO, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF FLORENCIO F. ENRIQUEZ, REPRESENTED BY ARMANDO ENRIQUEZ, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[5] for Declaration of Nullity and Cancellation of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-3,588,[6] issued in the name of Hrs. of Florencio Enriquez, rep. by: Armando Enriquez,"" and Declaration of Ownership over Lot Nos. 3564, 3566, and 3567 (subject lots), with prayer for issuance of temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) filed by petitioners and their now deceased siblings, Estelita F. Enriquez, Derticio F. Enriquez, Rosita Ruste Vda. De Enriquez, Policarpo Enriquez, and attorney-in-fact, Abelardo F. Enriquez (Abelardo),[7] on August 5, 2002 against the Heirs of Florencio F. Enriquez (Florencio), represented by Armando Enriquez (Armando; collectively, respondents).[8] In their prayer for preliminary injunctive relief, petitioners sought to enjoin: (1) the continuation of the proceedings in the ejectment case earlier filed by respondents in July 2002 before Branch 4, Municipal Trial Court, Zamboanga City (MTC), docketed as Special Civil Action No. 6256- 571,[9] and (2) respondents from further entering the subject lots and causing irreparable damage to petitioners' interest.[10]

As culled from the records, petitioners and Florencio are the heirs of the late Faustino W. Enriquez (Faustino), who died on August 9, 1956. Petitioners alleged that in 1948, Faustino bought three parcels of agricultural land, the subject lots, from one Ong Yok in consideration of the sum of PHP 5,000.00. Albeit the name of Florencio, Faustino's eldest son, was placed as the vendee in the ""Escritura de Venta""[11] covering the three lots, petitioners argued that Faustino bought the subject lots for his children by his second marriage, herein petitioners.

Fulfilling their father's intention, Florencio executed a Deed of Sale, likewise denominated as ""Escritura de Venta,""[12] on July 18, 1952 covering the subject lots in favor of petitioners. Due to an inadvertent omission of Tita's name in said Deed, Florencio subsequently executed an Affidavit[13] on September 28, 1956 to rectify such omission.[14] Petitioners asserted that they have been in open and continuous possession of the subject lots, which they have cultivated by planting coconut trees and other minor crops.[15]

Sometime in 1989, Abelardo took charge of the cultivation of the subject lots after their brother Romeo, who was previously in charge of its administration, left for abroad. To his surprise, Abelardo received a letter from respondents' counsel on June 22, 2002 demanding them to vacate the subject lots. Upon verification, Abelardo discovered that a free patent covering Lot No. 3564 was issued in Florencio 's name by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Thereafter, OCT No. P-3,588 covering Lot No. 3564 was issued on July 18, 1997 in respondents' name. Subsequently, Abelardo received summons from the MTC in the ejectment case filed against them.

Petitioners argued that the DENR had no jurisdiction over Lot No. 3564 since it is not a part of the public domain, having been owned by one Ong Yok since 1931 until the sale to Faustino. Moreover, they were the ones who have been paying the realty taxes thereon.[16]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Julieta F. Enriquez, Romeo F. Enriquez (Romeo), and Tita E. Velasco (Tita; collectively, petitioners), assailing the Decision[2] dated January 8, 2014 and the Resolution[3] dated September 19, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 02026-MIN. The assailed CA rulings reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated July 27, 2009 of Branch 14, Regional Trial Court, Zamboanga City (RTC) in Civil Case No. 5289 granting petitioners' Complaint for Declaration of Nullity and Cancellation of Title and Declaration of Ownership.","The Petition is granted.

Prefatorily, it must be stressed that in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law can be raised. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.[52]

A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts. If the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact. The test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.[53]

In this case, petitioners assert that the issue raised in this case, i.e., whether the CA erred in refusing to remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of trial and resolution of the case on the merits, is purely one of law since it simply requires a determination of whether the RTC gravely erred or abused its discretion in deciding on the merits of the case despite the issues not having been joined due to the absence of a pre-trial, and thereafter submitting the case for resolution. Viewed in this light, the Court agrees that the question as presented is one of law that a petition for review on certiorari contemplates.

Nonetheless, the resolution of this issue will necessarily require the Court to review the entire records of the case, including the entire proceedings before the trial court, to determine whether indeed (i) the hearing and presentation of evidence conducted before the trial court were simply for the determination of whether petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a WPI should be granted, and (ii) the issues have not been joined, due to the absence of a pre-trial, and thereafter submitted for resolution. A review of the records is rendered unavoidable considering that the RTC explicitly stated in its Decision that ""[i]ssues having been joined, pre-trial and trial on the merits proceeded.""[54] Verily, these entail factual determination that is not proper in a Rule 45 petition.

The foregoing notwithstanding, case law has recognized several exceptions to the rule, namely: (a) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (b) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (c) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (d) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (e) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (f) when in making its findings the CA went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (g) when the findings are contrary to those of the trial court; (h) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (i) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (j) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (k) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[55]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court resolves to GRANT the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The assailed Decision dated January 8, 2014 and the Resolution dated September 19, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 02026-MIN are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is hereby REMANDED to Branch 14, Regional Trial Court, Zamboanga City for trial on the merits and resolution of the case docketed as Civil Case No. 5289 WITH DISPATCH."

Contrary to law, qualified by the circumstance of minority of offended party ""AAA"" (17 years old).[7]

On arraignment, Sofia pleaded not guilty to the crimes filed against her. Thereafter, pre-trial and trial on the merits ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented Dr. Janice Joy Goboc Tan (Dr. Tan), AAA, BBB, FFF, and Senior Police Officer I Dennis O. Valdehueza (SPO1 Valdehueza) as its witnesses.[9]","Individuals engaged in trafficking of persons may be validly arrested through a decoy solicitation from a law enforcement officer. It is a form of an entrapment operation conducted not only to catch offenders in flagrante but also to facilitate ""the rescue of trafficked victims.""[1]
This Court resolves a Notice of Appeal[2] challenging the Court of Appeals Decision,[3] affirming the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] finding Ceferina Mendez (Sofia) a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" guilty of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons.

Three separate Informations were filed against Sofia charging her with qualified trafficking in persons and child abuse.[5] They read:","The Office of the Solicitor General countered that Sofia's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. It insisted that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses proved that Sofia committed the crime charged.[33]

Finally, it denied that Sofia was instigated to commit the offense, given that the criminal intent to perform the acts originated from Sofia herself. It maintained that even prior to the entrapment operation, Sofia had already been pimping minors and was the subject of several complaints.[34]

In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals sustained Sofia's conviction.[35] It affirmed the Regional Trial Court's finding that all elements of the crime trafficking in persons were established by the prosecution.[36] It also found unmeritorious Sofia's claim of instigation and stressed that similar to a buy-bust operation in drugs cases, the decoy solicitation of the police officers cannot be considered as a means to induce or instigate the perpetrator.[37]

As to the alleged nonreceipt of payment, the Court of Appeals emphasized that ""the act of receiving the money as payment is not an element of the crime.""[38]

Dissatisfied with its Decision, Sofia filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals.[39]

On March 22, 2023, this Court resolved to note the records of this case forwarded by the Court of Appeals and to require the parties to submit their supplemental briefs.[40]

The People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General,[41] and Sofia[42] respectively manifested that they would no longer file supplemental briefs.

The issues for this Court's resolution are:

Whether accused-appellant Ceferina Mendez a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons; and

Whether there was a valid entrapment operation.

We find the appeal unmeritorious.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The February 10, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 02343 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Ceferina Mendez a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" is found GUILTY of the following:

Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.


The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
In People v. Casio,[55] the elements of trafficking in persons were enumerated based on its expanded definition:
Under Republic Act No. 10364, the elements of trafficking in persons have been expanded to include the following acts:
     
 	
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;""
 	
(2)
The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""
 	
(3)
The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs[.]""[56] (Emphasis in original)
In this case, the accused-appellant was charged with violation of qualified trafficking in persons, punishable under Section 4(a) and (e) of the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012. The acts punishable under said provisions are as follows:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation;



. . . .


(e)
To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography[.]
Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9208 provides for the circumstances that qualify the crime. Here, the particular qualifying circumstances are ""the trafficked person is a child""[57] and ""the crime is committed...in large scale""[58] as provided in Section 6(a) and (c). Qualified trafficking is ""committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group.""[59]

All the elements of qualified trafficking in persons are present in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The January 27, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CR HC No. 02846 is hereby AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Wilfreda Laput Campos a.k.a. ""Freda"" is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of qualified human trafficking, under Section 4(a) and (e) in relation to Section 6(a) and (c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.

"G.R. No. 262034, May 22, 2024 ","MERCURIA B. MAGSI, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF IGNACIO A. LOPEZ, JR., NAMELY: DELIA DE GUZMAN LOPEZ AND LORRAINE DE GUZMAN LOPEZ, AND RODOLFO BARNACHEA, SR., RESPONDENTS.","On March 9, 2017, Mercuria B. Magsi (Magsi), represented by her daughter Maria Frances M. Mangaoang, filed a Complaint[6] against the Heirs of Ignacio A. Lopez, Jr. (Ignacio), namely: Delia De Guzman and Lorraine De Guzman Lopez, and Rodolfo Barnachea, Sr. (Rodolfo) (collectively, respondents), for Forcible Entry and Damages docketed as Civil Case No. 14049, after failing to arrive at an amicable settlement with the respondents.[7] In the Complaint, Magsi stated that she worked as an employee at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in Baguio City from February 1964 until her retirement in 2004. During her employment with DPWH, she resided at the National Government Dormitory, Dormitory I, in Jungle Town, Engineers' Hill, Baguio City and became a member of the Engineers Hill Lotless Homeseekers Association, Inc. (Association).[8]

Magsi stated that sometime in 1969, Republic Act No. 5941 was passed, amending Republic Act No. 1361, granting the National Government the authority to sell cottages in Baguio City, including the lot on which subject property is located, as follows:
Sec. 3. [. . .] that every cottage and lot on which it is built including the furniture and equipment in Jungle Town and Engineer's Hill shall be sold at a price to be fixed by the committee on Appraisal payable in ten yearly installments, to the present lessee or occupant thereof who has continuously leased or occupied them for not less than three years prior to the date of the approval of this amendatory act, unless such lessee or occupant refuses to exercise the right herein granted [. . .].[9]
Magsi submitted her application on March 20, 1981. The Association referred her application to the Screening and Recommending Awards Committee for Lot No. 59, SWO-1-01039. After due proceedings, Magsi was awarded Lot No. 50 since she had been occupying the said lot and had built a bodega therein since 1981.[10]

In 1990, Magsi introduced several repairs on the bodega located in Lot No. 50. In 1991, it was rebuilt into a residential house after a major earthquake hit Baguio City. In 1993, Magsi declared her residential house/building for tax purposes. On the other hand, Lot No. 50 was earlier declared for tax purposes as early as 1990.[11] Magsi further narrated that one Ernesto A. Hernandez filed an application over a lot in Engineers' Hill, which led to an investigation conducted by the Land Management Services of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). However, Ernesto's application was denied since the lot application encroached upon Lot No. 50.[12]

Magsi averred that she often traveled to the United States but she always made it a point to visit Lot No. 50. She also instructed her children to handle the processing of the award and titling of the lot, but some of her children got married and moved out, leaving only Magsi and her two younger children as occupants of the lot. According to her, she had been in possession of Lot No. 50 since 1981, while awaiting for the issuance of the title under Republic Act No. 1361, as amended by Republic Act No. 5941.[13]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 156585, which reversed and set aside the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 5, Baguio City, in Civil Case No. 8842-R. The RTC affirmed the Decision[5] of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 3, Baguio City in Civil Case No. 14049.","The petition is meritorious.

An action for forcible entry is governed by Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which provides:
Section 1. Who may institute proceedings, and when. — Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal representatives or assigns of any such lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person, may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper Municipal Trial Court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs.
Thus, the following elements must be alleged and proved: (1) that the plaintiff had prior physical possession of the property; (2) that the plaintiff was deprived of possession either by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth; and (3) that the action was filed within one year from the time the owners or legal possessors learned of their deprivation of the physical possession of the property.[36] The main point of contention is whether Magsi was able to prove that she had a prior physical possession over the subject property.

We rule in the affirmative.

It is undisputed that Magsi occupied and built a residential house on Lot No. 50 as early as 1991. In 1993, she declared her residential house/building for tax purposes. Meanwhile, based on OCT No. P-3097 of the Register of Deeds of Baguio City, Lot No. 49 was awarded to Ignacio through a Special Patent pursuant to Republic Act No. 1361 on July 27, 2004. Notably, the parties stipulated that the property sought to be recovered by Magsi encroaches upon Lot No. 49, which is titled in the name of Ignacio. Such fact is also supported by the sketch plan of land prepared by Geodetic Engineer Bobby M. Villena.[37] Thus, while the CA correctly held that possession can be acquired through juridical acts, i.e., the execution and registration of the deed of absolute sale in favor of Ignacio, Magsi's prior physical possession since 1991 has been well­-established and even admitted by respondents. While Magsi did not have prior physical possession over the entire Lot No. 49, the subject property whose possession Magsi seeks to recover is inside Lot No. 49. Therefore, as between Magsi and the respondents, Magsi sufficiently proved that she had a prior physical possession of the subject property.

As correctly pointed out by Magsi, this case is in stark contrast with the factual milieu in the cases of Mangaser and Spouses Orencia.","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 240320, May 22, 2024","THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN LIFE AND GENERAL INSURANCE [PHILAM LIFE] COMPANY* AND PABLITO BAIS, PETITIONERS, VS. ROMEO D. SORIANO AND MARIA LUISA R. SORIANO,** RESPONDENTS.","At the pith of the instant Petition is the disapproved accident insurance claim filed by respondent Romeo D. Soriano (Romeo).

Romeo was employed as an account executive at Shooters Guns and Ammunition Corporation, a business engaged in the selling of firearms and ammunitions. He obtained accident insurance policies from the following insurance companies: 
Name of Insurer
Policy No. & Coverage
Malayan Insurance
RJ-0054200100008 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
Great Domestic Insurance
PA 2670 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
Commonwealth Insurance
PA-980764 12-29-01 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
FGU Insurance
BPA-100162 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
UCPB Insurance
CGY00PD-PlP000558 for PHP 500,000.00
Philam Life Insurance
W443343 and W443344 for [PHP] 300,000.00 and [PHP] 500,000.00, respectively.[5]
On January 29, 2001, Romeo tripped as he was coming out of the bathroom, causing his right eye to hit the arm rest of a chair. He called out to his spouse, respondent Maria Luisa R. Soriano (Luisa), who promptly rushed to his side.[6]

Romeo was immediately brought to the clinic of Dr. Reynaldo Villanueva (Dr. Villanueva). After a series of check-ups, he was admitted at the Manuel J. Santos Hospital in Butuan City and underwent an enucleation, a surgical procedure involving the removal of his right eye. The post-operative diagnosis was ""traumatic endophthalmitis, absolute glaucoma, OD, SIP Enucleation and implant."" On account of the surgery, he incurred medical expenses in the sum of PHP 31,060.00.[7]

Consequently, Romeo filed written notices of injury with the above­named insurance companies. To his dismay, his claims were disapproved based on the joint affidavit of their former household helpers, Merced Amor (Amor) and Rofe Dellera (Dellera), who denied the occurrence of the accident. The joint affidavit was secured by Pablito Bais (Bais), who was hired to investigate the veracity of Romeo's claims. Meanwhile, a similar affidavit was secured by Manila Adjusters & Surveyors Company, the credit investigator of petitioner The Philippine American Life and General Insurance [Philam Life] Company (Philam Life).[8]

The disapproval of the claims prompted Romeo and Luisa (spouses Soriano) to lodge separate complaints before the RTC against Bais and the insurance companies for accident insurance proceeds, specific performance, damages, and attorney's fees. These complaints were docketed as Civil Case Nos. 5119, 5120, 5122, 5136, 5159, and 5160. The issues were joined and the case was set for pre-trial. The parties failed to reach a settlement. Thus, trial on the merits ensued.[9]

During the trial, spouses Soriano presented themselves and Dr. Villanueva as witnesses.[10] On the other hand, Philam Life and Bais proffered the testimony of Dellera and the medical opinion of Dr. Mario J. Valenton (Dr. Valenton), a credited physician of Philam Life.[11]

In due course, the RTC rendered its Judgment, dismissing the complaints based on the equipoise rule. The spouses Soriano moved for reconsideration, but their plea was denied in the Omnibus Resolution dated January 21, 2015.[12] Undeterred, they sought recourse before the CA, which granted their appeal via the repugned Decision.

The CA held that the RTC erroneously applied the equipoise rule given that ""the evidence of [s]pouses Soriano holds more weight than that of the insurance companies and Bais.""[13] Primarily, the CA banked on the medical findings and testimony of Dr. Villanueva, who performed the enucleation. Moreover, it drew attention to Dellera's admission that she noticed Romeo wearing a plaster on his right eye when he came home on January 29, 2001.[14]

Likewise, the CA found Romeo's claim of accident more credible, postulating that if his claim of accident were untrue, it follows that he deliberately caused the injury on his eye to claim insurance benefits. The CA also held that ""a self-inflicted injury that leaves [sic] a permanent damage on his eye seems very improbable considering that he could have injured other parts of his body to claim insurance proceeds.""[15]

Nevertheless, the CA affirmed the dismissal of the spouses Soriano's complaints against Bais as no evidence was adduced indicting him for acting with malice or bad faith in conducting his investigation of their claims.[16]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] impugns the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judgment[4] and which denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration, respectively, in CA-G.R. CV No. 04447-MIN.","The Court finds no compelling reason to cast aside the disposition of the CA.

At the outset, Philam Life and Bais raise issues which involve questions of fact. As a rule, these cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition. Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the court a quo. The Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo. Of course, the general rule admits of exceptions, such as where the factual findings of the CA and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory, as in this case.[20]

In Spouses Zapanta v. Rustan Commercial Corporation,[21] the Court so decreed:
In civil cases, the quantum of evidence to be observed is preponderance of evidence. Preponderance of evidence means that the evidence adduced by one side is superior to or has greater weight than that of the other. It means that evidence which is more convincing to the Court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. Under Section 1, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, in determining whether or not there is preponderance of evidence, the court may consider the following: (a) all the facts and circumstances of the case; (b) the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony; (c) the witnesses' interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may ultimately appear in the trial; and (d) the number of witnesses, although it does not mean that preponderance is necessarily with the greater number.[22]
Moreover, Spouses Zapanta teaches that when the evidence of the parties are evenly balanced or when there is doubt on which side the evidence preponderates, the decision should be against the party with the burden of proof, according to the equipoise doctrine.[23]

As unequivocally ruled by the CA, the RTC erred in applying the equipoise rule considering that spouses Soriano were able to prove through preponderance of evidence that Romeo's injury was caused by an accident, thus entitling him to the proceeds of the subject accident insurance policies.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The February 22, 2018 Decision and the June 20, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04447-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

ORBETA, RESPONDENTS.","On June 27, 2015, Rudy T. Ampolitod was hired by Top Ever Marine Management Phils. Inc. (Top Ever) for and in behalf of its principal, TEMM Maritime Company, Ltd. (TEMM Maritime) as an Able-Bodied Seaman to work on board the vessel ""M/V"" Coral Opal for a period of nine months. Prior to this employment, Ampolitod was hired continuously by Top Ever for and on behalf of TEMM Maritime since 2009 to work on board different vessels under various positions.[5] Prior to his deployment, Ampolitod was given a clean bill of health by the company-designated doctors.[6]

On August 25, 2015, Ampolitod joined ""M/V"" Coral Opal. Sometime in October 2015, almost two months after embarkation and while on board the vessel, Ampolitod suddenly felt dizzy, weak, and tired. On October 22, 2015, Ampolitod requested permission from the vessel's Master to have a medical examination at a medical clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America for his complete blood count (CBC).[7] According to his Hematology results, Ampolitod had a platelet count of 51 L, below the normal platelet count of 150-400.[8]

On October 25, 2015, Ampolitod noticed bruising on his legs, arms, and other body parts. In addition, Ampolitod felt dizzy and had blurred vision.[9] The following day, the vessel's Master sent him to West Jefferson Medical Center for medical treatment. The attending physician diagnosed Ampolitod with Thrombocytopenia and was advised to see a hematologist.[10] In addition, Ampolitod was declared unfit to work and recommended his repatriation.[11]

On October 29, 2015, Ampolitod was medically repatriated and arrived in the Philippines on October 30, 2015. On October 31, 2015, respondents had him admitted at the Manila Doctors Hospital where he was monitored and treated by the hematology team from that day until November 21, 2015. The company-designated physician's impression was Pancytopenia Secondary to Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura. Said condition is compatible with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), as confirmed by the November 16, 2015 bone marrow biopsy result.[12] The company-designated physician also sent a specimen of Ampolitod's bone marrow for cytogenetic analysis to the Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory of St. Luke's Medical Center. The cytogenetic report of December 10, 2015 showed that Ampolitod's illness is not genetic in nature.[13]

Respondents claim that during medical history taking at Manila Doctors Hospital, Ampolitod admitted that sometime in June 2015, he suffered from Isolated Anemia but was subsequently cleared for employment abroad. Ampolitod was asymptomatic until three months later when he noted anterior chest wall petechial and right calf and arm hematoma.

Ampolitod started treatment on October 31, 2015, and continued until May 2016 for almost seven months. Sometime in May 2016, Ampolitod's treatment was discontinued after his CBC showed normal result and that he was already fit to work.[14] Even after the discontinued treatment, the company physician recommended that Ampolitod continue monitoring his CBC.[15] Thus, Ampolitod regularly underwent CBC testing at Capital University Medical Center in his province in Cagayan De Oro. Ampolitod furnished the company-designated physicians his CBC results from January 20, 2016 until August 5, 2017, all of which showed below than normal results, especially on the platelet count. Ampolitod also continued to suffer from dizziness, bruising on his body, and blurred vision.[16]

During this time, Ampolitod also regularly visited Dr. Alisa Q. Queja (Dr. Queja), an internal medicine-hematologist in his hometown, for follow­up monitoring of his CBC. In a Medical Certificate dated September 6, 2017, Dr. Queja, under diagnosis MOS, declared Ampolitod ""Not fit to work.""[17] Ampolitod also sought the medical opinion of Dr. May S. Donato-Tan (Dr. Donato-Tan), an internal medicine cardiologist at the Philippine Heart Center, who declared him permanently disabled.

Consequently, on November 3, 2017, Ampolitod filed before the Labor Arbiter (LA) a complaint to recover permanent total disability benefits.[18]

During the mandatory conference, the parties agreed to refer the matter to a third doctor - Dr. Ivy Mae Escasa (Dr. Escasa), an internal medicine-adult hematologist In a Report dated January 25, 2018, Dr. Escasa confirmed Ampolitod's MDS and made the following remarks: (1) placed his survival at 8.8 years; (2) that he has a low risk to develop acute myeloid leukemia; and (3) she recommended that Ampolitod not be allowed to work as a seafarer anymore. However, the report of Dr. Escasa did not indicate that the illness was work-related.[19]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Rudy T.

However, the foregoing rule admits of certain exceptions, such as when the lower courts have conflicting findings of fact.[39]

In this case, the conflicting factual findings by the LA on one hand, and the NLRC as affirmed by CA on the other, compels this Court to delve into the records and examine for itself the questioned findings.[40]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

That on or about 19th of September 2010, in Barangay Dinahican, Municipality of Infanta, Province of Quezon, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to gain, armed with hammer, scissors[,] and other instruments used to open wall[s] and door[s], conspiring, confederating[,] and mutually helping each other, did then and there, willfully, feloniously[,] and unlawfully, destroyed the wall of the house with store owned by ZENAIDA ANGARA, and once inside[,] take, steal[,] and cart away the following: a) cash amounting to more or less PHP 20,000.00 and packs of Marlboro and Philip Cigarettes amounting to more or less PHP 35,000.00, with the total amount of PHP 55,000.00, without the complainant's consent and against her will[,] and to the damage and prejudice of the complainant in the aforementioned amount, afterwards the accused forcibly pushed the door of the room wherein the complainant and her children were located, which the complainant pushed back the said door of the room wherein the accused tried to enter.[6]
Dimaapi was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on March 8, 2011. Almost two years later, Supranes was apprehended and also pleaded not guilty. The John Doe remained at large, thereby leaving Dimaapi and Supranes to stand trial.[7]

The prosecution alleged that private complainant Zenaida Angara (Angara) owns a grocery store, portions of which she and her family use as their house/living quarters. At around 3:00 a.m. of September 19, 2010, Angara and her kids were sleeping in a room inside said store when her stay­ in store saleslady, Lorena Atendido (Atendido), knocked at Angara's room to inform the latter that she saw a person inside the store with a flashlight. Angara let Atendido inside the room, and thereafter, called her brother-in­ law, Jerribel Madriaga (Madriaga) via mobile phone, asking him to help. While waiting for Madriaga, Angara slightly opened the door to peek, and saw a man-later identified as Dimaapi-who, upon seeing Angara peeking, turned off his flashlight and rushed towards the room. Fortunately for Angara, she was able to immediately close the door and block it.[8]

Shortly thereafter, Madriaga, together with the barangay tanods (Madriaga, et al.) arrived and climbed the roof of Angara's store to retrieve the keys to the store through a hole in the ceiling so that they could enter through the store's front door. While they were on the roof, Madriaga, et al. saw two men fleeing but they failed to recognize them as they were wearing bonnets. Upon getting the keys, Madriaga, et al. went and opened the store's front door. They immediately searched the entire store and eventually found Dimaapi underneath an empty box of soy sauce and in between sacks of rice and cases of beer at the bodega. Madriaga, et al. then apprehended Dimaapi and found out that the latter was equipped with a hammer, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair of longnose pliers, a screwdriver, a cutter, a double­ bladed knife, a bonnet, and a set of keys. Madriaga, et al. then questioned Dimaapi about his companions and the latter replied that he was with Supranes and another man whose name he does not know.[9]

After Dimaapi was detained, Madriaga, et al., together with Angara who had come out from her room, checked the grocery store and discovered that PHP 20,000.00 worth of coins and PHP 35,000.00 worth of cigarettes were already missing. Furthermore, they saw that a wall of the grocery store which was made of galvanized iron was destroyed, thereby surmising that Dimaapi and his cohorts were the ones who destroyed it to gain entry into the store. Thereafter, they brought Dimaapi to the barangay hall and turned him over to the responding police officers.[10]

In defense, Dimaapi denied the allegations against him. He averred that on the date and time of the incident, he was buying bread and cigarettes from a nearby bakery when Angara invited him to go to her store. According to Dimaapi, when he arrived at Angara's store, she told him to enter the store, which he did. Dimaapi then claimed that a few moments later, barangay tanods arrived, arrested him, and detained him at the barangay hall. Finally, Dimaapi said that he was taken to the police station and it was only then that he found out that he was being charged with robbery.[11]

For his part, Supranes interposed the defenses of denial and alibi. He maintained that from around 7:00 p.m. of September 18, 2010, until around 7:00 a.m. of September 19, 2010, he was sleeping at his house located in Purok Kamias, Brgy. Ungos Real, Quezon, with his mother and sister. After waking up, he ate breakfast and left his house at around 8:30 a.m. to report to his work as a kargador in the same area.[12]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated February 27, 2018 and the Resolution[3] dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 39790 which partially affirmed the Decision[4] dated February 3, 2017 of Branch 65, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Infanta, Quezon. The CA resolution, in effect, upheld the conviction of petitioner Ron De Guzman Dimaapi (Dimaapi) for the crime of robbery in an inhabited house, as defined and penalized under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The Petition is without merit.

In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[21]

Given this consideration, the Court upholds Dimaapi 's conviction with modification as to his civil liability ex delicto, as will be explained hereunder.

Pertinent portions of Article 299 of the RPC, as amended, read:
Article 299. Robbery in an inhabited house or public building or edifice devoted to worship. - Any armed person who shall commit robbery in an inhabited house or public building or edifice devoted to religious worship, shall be punished by reclusion temporal, if the value of the property taken shall exceed PHP 50,000, and if--

(a) The malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the robbery was committed, by any of the following means:

x x x x

2. By breaking any wall roof or floor or breaking any door or window.

x x x x

When the offenders do not carry arms, and the value of the property taken exceeds PHP 50,000, the penalty next lower in degree shall be imposed.

The same rule shall be applied when the offenders are armed, but the value of the property taken does not exceed PHP 50,000.

When said offenders do not carry arms and the value of the property taken does not exceed PHP 50,000, they shall suffer the penalty prescribed in the two next preceding paragraphs, in its minimum period.

If the robbery be committed in one of the dependencies of an inhabited house, public building, or building dedicated to religious worship, the penalties next lower in degree than those prescribed in this article shall be imposed.
In Tumog v. People,[22] the Court reiterated that ""[t]o be convicted of this form of robbery, it is necessary that the following elements are proved: (1) unlawful taking; (2) of personal property belonging to another; (3) with intent to gain; and (4) with force upon things, i.e., by breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door or window to enter the building where the robbery is committed. Additionally, the penalty to be imposed is dependent on the value of the things taken and whether or not the offender carries arms.""[23]

Here, it is well to recapitulate that while the CA noted that Dimaapi was not found to be in possession of the cash and goods stolen from Angara's grocery store, his complicity in the robbery committed thereat was nevertheless proven beyond reasonable doubt through circumstantial evidence.

The Court agrees.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated February 27, 2018 and the Resolution dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39790 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Ron De Guzman Dimaapi is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery in an inhabited house, as defined and penalized under Article 299 (a)(2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight years and one day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 14 years, eight months, and one day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; and is ordered to pay Zenaida Angara the amount of PHP 55,000.00 as actual damages,with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 254838, May 22, 2024","JESSICA LUCILA G. REYES, PETITIONER, VS. DIRECTOR OR WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF CAMP BAGONG DIWA, TAGUIG, METRO MANILA, JCINSP. WENA FE DALAGAN, WARDEN, TAGUIG CITY JAIL FEMALE DORMITORY, RESPONDENTS.","On June 5, 2014, an Information charged petitioner with Plunder.[3] Through the Order of Commitment (commitment order)[4] dated July 9, 2014, the Sandiganbayan directed the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) to take custody of petitioner. The Order of Commitment reads:
We hereby commit to you the person of [PETITIONER], who is charged with PLUNDER (Section 2, R.A. No. 7080) in SB-14-CRM-0238, entitled People of the Philippines versus JUAN PONCE ENRILE, ET AL., and for violation of Section 3(e), of R.A. No. 3019 in SB-14-CRM-0241-0255, entitled People of the Philippines versus JUAN PONCE ENRILE, ET AL., pursuant to this Court's Minute Resolution dated July 9, 2014.[5]
In her Petition for Habeas Corpus[6] dated January 13, 2021, petitioner stated that she was under detention at the Taguig City Jail-Female Dormitory, BJMP-National Capital Region Compound, Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig, Metro Manila (Taguig City Jail Female Dormitory) since July 9, 2014[7] or close to nine years.[8] Because of such prolonged detention amounting to a violation of her right to speedy trial, petitioner's only recourse was to invoke the remedy of habeas corpus before this Court.[9]

Several pleadings were exchanged between the parties exhaustively arguing their positions on habeas corpus and an accused's right to speedy trial under the Constitution.

On January 17, 2023, the Court issued a Resolution granting the Petition for Habeas Corpus and setting stringent conditions for petitioner's release from detention. In all, We found that petitioner's confinement, though in accordance with a court order of the Sandiganbayan, has become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.[10]

Thus, the dispositive portion of Our Resolution states:[11]
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Habeas Corpus dated January 13, 2021 is GRANTED subject to the following conditions:

1) Petitioner Jessica Lucila G. Reyes shall personally attend the hearings of the criminal cases filed against her before the Sandiganbayan;

2) Petitioner shall submit a quarterly periodic report to the Clerk of Court of the Sandiganbayan of her whereabouts;

3) Petitioner shall secure a travel authority from the Sandiganbayan in cases of foreign travel on her part, and to physically present herself to the Sandiganbayan and submit a report of her return within five days of her arrival in the country;

4) Petitioner shall submit to this Court, through the Office of the Clerk of Court, a quarterly report of her compliance with the foregoing conditions.

The release of petitioner shall be without prejudice to her re-arrest and detention should she fail to comply with any of the conditions stated herein.","Before this Court is the Omnibus Motion[1] filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). In the Omnibus Motion, the OSG essentially argues that the factual and legal bases of this Court's January 17, 2023 Resolution should be reconsidered and re-examined.[2]","The Court resolves to DENY WITH FINALITY the Omnibus Motion dated February 3, 2023 for failure to advance substantial arguments to merit reconsideration of the factual and legal bases cited in Our January 17, 2023 Resolution.

At the outset, We note that the substantive arguments in the Omnibus Motion were rehashed and already exhaustively passed upon by this Court in the January 17, 2023 Resolution. To recall, in the assailed Resolution, We have already exhaustively presented a discussion on the constitutional right to liberty against the right to speedy trial. We also held that the ""right to speedy trial is violated when: (1) the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or (2) unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured; or (3) without cause or justifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to lapse without the party having his or her case tried."" We also laid down the standards in the grant of the writ of habeas corpus anchored on a violation of the right to speedy trial. And based on these standards, We have concluded that the writ of habeas corpus is available to petitioner. Her confinement, though in accordance with a court order of the Sandiganbayan, violates her constitutional right to speedy trial and infringes on her right to liberty.[25]

We have specifically and categorically identified the special attendant circumstances which merited the grant of the writ of habeas corpus. For reference, we reiterate:
Petitioner was able to prove that her detention had become a form of vexatious restraint, despite being detained by virtue of a court order. Petitioner has been under detention at the Taguig City Jail Female Dormitory since July 9, 2014, pursuant to the commitment order issued by the Sandiganbayan. While such order is lawful, petitioner's continued detention had become an undue restraint on her liberty due to the peculiar protracted proceedings attendant in the principal case.

As pointed out by petitioner, the proceeding was delayed due to the wrong markings in the prosecution's evidence. In order to correct the said errors, the Sandiganbayan was constrained to schedule additional preliminary conferences, which have considerably delayed the progress of the case. During the pre-trial stage, the Sandiganbayan issued two pre-trial orders, over her objection. To date, petitioner stated that it is not clear which between these two pre-trial orders are controlling, in accordance with Section 4, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, during trial, the Sandiganbayan has so far allowed only one witness per day, notwithstanding that trial is scheduled only twice a week and that the witnesses' testimonies are cumulative or similar in nature. Petitioner further contextualized the delay by noting that thousands of bundled marked exhibits are to be considered by the Sandiganbayan. To date, petitioner has been in detention for close to nine years, without assurance of the resolution of the case in sight, or that it can be speeded in accordance with law. She maintains that the trial commenced only on March 3, 2022, notwithstanding that the information was filed as early as June 5, 2014.","ACCORDINGLY, the Omnibus Motion dated February 3, 2023 is DENIED WITH FINALITY. No further pleadings shall be entertained. Let entry of judgment be issued in due course."

With the presence of the qualifying circumstance that at the time of the foregoing incidents; complainant was still a 14 year old child.","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] filed by Adrian Adrales y Jurado (Adrales) seeking the reversal of the Decision[2] dated March 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07727, which affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] dated August 14, 2015 of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 12-017, 12-018, and 12-019, finding Adrales guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. (RA) 9208[4] or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003.","The appeal has no merit.

""Section 3(a) of RA 9208 defines the term 'Trafficking in Persons' as the 'recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.' The same provision further provides that '[t]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.""[66]

Relatedly, Section 4 of the same law provides for an enumeration of acts constituting ""Trafficking in Persons"" which provides:

SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage; . . .

Thus, the elements of ""Trafficking in Persons"" within the context of Section 4(a) of RA 9208 are as follows: (a) the act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (b) the means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (c) the purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[67] Additionally, Section 6(a) of RA 9208 explicitly provides that ""Trafficking in Persons"" shall be in its qualified form ""when the trafficked person is a child.""

The Court agrees with the courts a quo that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the offense. In the case at bar, the testimony of AAA was direct, straightforward, and consistent. She clearly narrated that Adrales befriended her, and from there recruited her, frequently contacted her through text messages, and transported her to the places where she was to engage in sexual activities. This was not just with one man, but with two other men, and multiple times at that. In all these instances Adrales, as observed by both courts a quo, was with AAA before, during, and after her sexual encounters. AAA was also forthright that both she and Adrales were paid for her sexual ""services,"" and that this was the main reason why she was enticed to continue with the arrangement. Indeed, Adrales took advantage of AAA's invulnerability and would have continued to do so had Raquel not discovered the infidelity of her husband, which led to a confrontation with AAA and, in turn, led to AAA relating the incidents to her family.[68] Finally, AAA's minority was proven by the presentation of her Birth Certificate.[69]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated March 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07727 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Adrian Adrales y Jurado a.k.a.

"G.R. No. 262975, May 21, 2024","MAGKAKASAMA SA SAKAHAN, KAUNLARAN (MAGSASAKA) PARTY-LIST, REPRESENTED BY ITS SECRETARY­ GENERAL, ATTY. GENERAL D. DU PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND SOLIMAN VILLAMIN, JR., RESPONDENTS.","Two petitions to deny due course were filed before the COMELEC against the Villamin MIP: one by Atty. Du,[6] and another by Irish Fajilagot Alfon, Sandy Pande Santos, Jeffrey D. Cortazar, Jayson Molina, John Christopher Alrey Buena (Alfon et al.).[7]

In the first petition, Atty. Du claimed that Villamin does not have any legal standing to sign or file an MIP on behalf of the Party and has made an untruthful statement in his MIP when he misrepresented himself as the National Chairperson of the Party. According to Atty. Du, Villamin is the former National Chairperson of MAGSASAKA who was voted out of MAGSASAKA's Council of Leaders and expelled from the organization due to anomalous activities akin to ponzi or pyramiding schemes involving DV Boer, Inc. (DV Boer), Villamin's family corporation. As a result, two provincial coordinators of MAGSASAKA lodged letter-complaints against Villamin, Soliman Villamin, Sr., Joselyn Villamin, Crisanto ""King"" Cortez (Cortez), Marianne Co, and Joseph Masacupan (Villamin et al.), who were also members of the Council of Leaders. On June 28, 2019, the Council of Leaders decided to conduct an investigation on the activities of DV Boer and appointed Lejun Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) to investigate the matter.[8]

On November 3, 2019, Dela Cruz relayed to the Council of Leaders that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an advisory against DV Boer, the Department of Agriculture was on the ""look-out"" for DV Boer, and there was public confusion on whether the members of MAGSASAKA and those behind DV Boer were one and the same. Based on the report, the Council of Leaders suspended Villamin et al. from the Council of Leaders until their names were cleared of any impropriety, illegality, or unethical behavior so as not to drag the name of the Party in the said activities.[9]

On December 21, 2019, MAGSASAKA held a General Assembly where the attending members were informed of the suspension of Villamin et al. from the Council of Leaders. This was immediately followed by an election of a new set of Council of Leaders. Atty. Du claimed that Villamin et al. were notified of the meeting, but Villamin disputed this, maintaining that only Cortez was notified. Villamin, believing that his group's ouster was substantially and procedurally infirm, reported the incident to the COMELEC.[10]

On June 26, 2021, the MAGSASAKA faction of Atty. Du (Du faction) held another General Assembly, elected a new set of Council Leaders, and expelled Villamin et al. from the Party due to their involvement in the DV Boer scam, and the issuance of a warrant of arrest against them for syndicated estafa.[11]

In the second petition, Alfon et al. averred that they filed complaints against Villamin for estafa, syndicated estafa, and violations of the Securities Regulations Code for collecting investments from the public despite not having the necessary license from the SEC. They claimed that Villamin's filing of the MIP puts the election process in mockery or disrepute.[12]

On November 25, 2021, the COMELEC First Division issued a Resolution[13] in favor of Villamin, finding that his removal was in violation of MAGSASAKA's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin ng Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (Saligang Batas).[14] The COMELEC held that Villamin was neither notified of the meetings nor given a chance to refute the allegations against him contrary to the provisions of the Saligang Batas, thereby violating his right to due process. Even the general assemblies where he was suspended and expelled were not conducted in accordance with the Saligang Batas. Since MAGSASAKA failed to show that Villamin was validly suspended and eventually removed, he remained to be the National Chairperson when he filed his MIP.[15] The relevant portions of the assailed November 25, 2021 Resolution of the COMELEC First Division read:
Measured against these standards, We find that the procedure conducted by the faction of Petitioner Du in the suspension, removal from office, and replacement of Respondent [Villamin et al.] were not in accord with the procedure laid down in the Party's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin and were done in bad faith. Specifically, the procedure undertaken by the faction of Petitioner Du violated the right to due process guaranteed by the Saligang Batas at Alituntunin and the manner provided in Article VIII regarding the removal of elected party officials.[16]

....

All these show that Respondent [Villamin et al.] were not accorded their right to due process as inscribed in the Party's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin. Furthermore, the events leading to the suspension of Respondent [Villamin et al.] betray the bad faith of Petitioner Du s group. As such, We find that their suspension is invalid.[17]","While the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has jurisdiction over intra-party leadership disputes, it cannot arrogate unto itself the interpretation of party rules contrary to the party's established practices and confer party leadership to someone whom the party has already expelled.

Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari (with Application for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction, Status Quo Ante and/or Temporary Restraining Order)[1] filed by Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (MAGSASAKA) Party-list (Party), represented by its Secretary General, Atty. General D. Du (Atty. Du). MAGSASAKA claims that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing COMELEC First Division Resolution[2] dated November 25, 2021 and COMELEC En Banc Resolution[3] dated September 9, 2022 in the consolidated cases of SPP No. 21-002 (MIP) and SPP No. 21-003 (MIP).

MAGSASAKA is an organization duly accredited and registered by the COMELEC on January 17, 2019 as a regional party in Region III. For the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, two Manifestations of Intent to Participate (MIP) were filed under the name of MAGSASAKA. The first was filed by Atty. Du as MAGSASAKA Secretary General,[4] and the second by Soliman Villamin, Jr. (Villamin), claiming to be the MAGSASAKA National Chairperson (Villamin MIP).[5]","The Court is not persuaded.
 
Prior notice is not required under MAGSASAKA's Saligang Batas
 

Several members of the Court pointed out that nothing in the records show that Villamin was given prior notice of the expulsion proceedings against him, and that such omission was admitted by MAGSASAKA and Atty. Du. While such may be the case, the lack of prior notice did not render Villamin's removal as National Chairperson invalid.

Atienza v. COMELEC[87] tells us that the requirements of due process do not apply to the internal affairs of political parties. Being considered private organizations, the rights of party members are based on the organization's charter, which is a contract among party members.[88] Accordingly, the dispute within the party, in this case between MAGSASAKA and Villamin, should be resolved within the bounds of the party's charter, and not on any other consideration.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The COMELEC First Division Resolution dated November 25, 2021 and the COMELEC En Banc Resolution dated September 9, 2022 in the consolidated cases of SPP No. 21-002 (MIP) and SPP No. 21-003 (MIP), finding Soliman Villamin, Jr. as the duly authorized representative to file the Manifestation of Intent to Participate (MIP) in the Party-List System of Representation for the 2022 National and Local Elections, and denying Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (MAGSASAKA) Party-List's petition to deny due course to the said MIP are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

CITY GOVERNMENT OF TAGUM, CITY ASSESSOR AND CITY TREASURER OF TAGUM, PROVINCE OF DAVAO DEL NORTE, RESPONDENTS.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the twin dispositions of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1930:
1)
Decision[2] dated June 30, 2020, affirming the dismissal of the Petition for Prohibition filed by petitioner National Food Authority (NFA) to enjoin respondents City Government of Tagum, its City Assessor and City Treasurer and the Province of Davao del Norte from collecting real property taxes in the total amount of PHP 2,643,816.53; and


2)
Resolution[3] dated November 4, 2021 denying NFA's motion for reconsideration.","Taxes cannot be charged against the Republic of the Philippines from which the power to tax emanates in the first place. For the ""power to destroy"" ought not be used against the very entity that wields it.","We reverse.

At the outset, We stress anew that the principle of local autonomy under the 1987 Constitution simply means decentralization. It does not make local governments sovereign within the state or an imperium in imperio.[71] They are bound by the following tax principles in the exercise of their constitutionally delegated power to tax:
a)
Under Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution, ""[e]ach local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.""


b)
The basic rationale for the current rule on local fiscal autonomy is the strengthening of LGUs and the safeguarding of their viability and self-sufficiency through a direct grant of general and broad tax powers. The fundamental law nevertheless did not intend the delegation to be absolute and unconditional. Its exercise in fact is subject to limitations, among them, (a) the taxpayer should not be over-burdened or saddled with multiple and unreasonable impositions; (b) the resources of the national government, too, should not be unduly disturbed; and (c) local taxation should be fair, uniform, and just.[72]


c)
Although the power to tax is inherent in the State, the same is not true for LGUs. While the mandate to impose taxes granted to LGUs is categorical and long established in the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the same is not all encompassing as it is subject to limitations as explicitly stated in Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution. Being mere creatures of the State, LGUs cannot defeat national policies through enactments of contrary measures. They are governmental agencies, the establishment of which did not divest the State of any of its sovereignty.[73]



Verily, ""[w]hen local governments invoke the power to tax on national government instrumentalities, such power is construed strictly against local governments. The rule is that a tax is never presumed and there must be clear language in the law imposing the tax. Any doubt whether a person, article or activity is taxable is resolved against taxation. This rule applies with greater force when local governments seek to tax national government instrumentalities.""[74]
This is not merely a tax policy but rooted in the very exercise of the inherent power of taxation of the national government—exemptions of agencies of government are recognized, i.e., the means or agencies selected by the government as necessary or convenient to the exercise of its functions cannot be subjected to the taxing power.[75] More, taxes are financial burdens imposed for the purpose of raising revenues with which to defray the cost of the operation of the Government, and a tax on property of the Government, whether national or local, would merely have the effect of taking money from one pocket to put it in another pocket.[76]

In MIAA,[77] the Court was more emphatic, thus, ""[t]he reason for the rule does not apply in the case of exemptions running to the benefit of the government itself or its agencies. In such a case the practical effect of an exemption is merely to reduce the amount of money that has to be handled by the government in the course of its operations. For these reasons, provisions granting exemptions to government agencies may be construed liberally, in favor of non-tax liability of such agencies. ""There is, moreover, no point in national and local governments taxing each other, unless a sound and compelling policy requires such transfer of public funds from one government pocket to another.""[78]

Even Section 133(o) of the Local Gov't Code,[79] as amended, recognizes the basic principle that local governments cannot tax the national government, which historically merely delegated to local governments the power to tax. While the 1987 Constitution now includes taxation as one of the powers of local governments, local governments may only exercise such power subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide.[80]

More than being a mere transfer of funds from one pocket of the government to the other, as laid down in Basco v. PAGCOR,[81] the whole point why LGUs cannot tax the national government instrumentalities is they absolutely have no power by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden or in any manner control the operation of constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the power vested in the [national government]. This doctrine emanates from the ""supremacy"" of the National Government over LGUs.[82] Otherwise, mere creatures of the State can defeat national policies [through] extermination of what local authorities may perceive to be undesirable activities or enterprise using the power to tax as ""a tool for regulation.""[83]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 30, 2020 and Resolution dated November 4, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1930 are REVERSED.

"A.C. No. 13368 [Formerly CBD Case No. 13-3851], May 21, 2024","WILLIAM S. UY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ELERIZZA A. LIBIRAN-METEORO, RESPONDENT.","Uy alleged that he was a representative of the Maliliw Lending Corporation. Sometime in the last quarter of 2012, Atty. Libiran-Meteoro accompanied her client Rowena Lopez (Lopez), to Maliliw Lending Corporation's office to assist Lopez in a transaction. Later on, Atty. Libiran-Metereo returned and applied for a personal loan herself which she promised to pay via post-dated checks. Relying on her representations that the post­dated checks will be good when they fall due, he agreed.[2]

Atty. Libiran-Meteoro thus issued three postdated checks in favor of Maliliw Lending Corporation, two of which are described as: (1) RCBC Savings Bank Check No. 1492854 dated March 14, 2013, in the amount of PHP 122,500.00; and (2) RCBC Savings Bank Check No. 1492855 dated April 14, 2013 in the amount of PHP 122,500.00 (subject checks). As it was, the subject checks got dishonored when they were deposited on their respective due dates, due to ""ACCOUNT CLOSED"" and ""DAIF"" or drawn against insufficient funds. He allegedly called Atty. Libiran-Meteoro's attention regarding the dishonored checks but his calls were ignored.[3]

He discovered that in 2014, Atty. Libiran-Meteoro had been suspended from the practice of law for six months for gross misconduct in Barrientos v. Atty. Libiran-Meteoro.[4] Despite this, she again committed acts constituting gross misconduct[5] and was not deterred from defrauding businesspersons like him. She allegedly continued to evade his calls, causing him damage in the amount of PHP 245,000.00.[6]",Complainant William S. Uy (Uy) charged respondent Atty. Elerizza A. Libiran-Meteoro (Atty. Libiran-Meteoro) with gross misconduct for issuing two bouncing checks and failing to pay her debt despite demands.[1],"First off, Members of the Bar are now governed by the new Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) which took effect on May 30, 2023. Notably, its provisions shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except where the same would not be feasible or would work injustice.[20] Though Atty. Libiran-Meteoro's acts were committed way back 2012, the provisions of the CPRA shall nonetheless serve as the metric to determine her administrative liability.

Lawyers are instruments for the administration of justice. As vanguards of our legal system, they are expected to maintain not only legal proficiency but also a high standard of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.[21] Thus, lawyers may be disciplined for any conduct, whether in their professional or in their private capacity, if such conduct renders them unfit to continue to be officers of the court.[22]   
 ","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Elerizza A. Libiran-Meteoro is found GUILTY of gross misconduct for her issuance of worthless checks, in violation of Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is DISBARRED from the practice of law and her name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.

She is also found GUILTY of violation of the IBP rules and issuances governing membership in the IBP for her failure to report the change in her residence or office address and is meted a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00.

MACASAET, AND WILFREDO P. CU, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","In 1966, PNCC, formerly Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), was incorporated as a stock corporation pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, otherwise known as the ""Corporation Code of the Philippines"" (Corporation Code). CDCP was engaged in the business of general construction.[4]

In 1977, CDCP was granted a franchise under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1113 to construct, operate, and maintain toll facilities in the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).[5] The franchise was effective for a period of 30 years from May 1, 1977,[6] or until May 1, 2007.[7]

During its operations, CDCP incurred substantial credit obligations from both private and government sources. However, CDCP could not settle its maturing credit obligations to several government financial institutions (GFIs) as they fell due.[8]

On February 23, 1983, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1295 for the rehabilitation of CDCP and the conversion of its obligations to its creditor GFIs into equity in CDCP.[9] Following the debt-to-equity conversion, the government became the owner of 76.8% of the authorized capital stock of CDCP.[10] It was also renamed as PNCC to reflect the extent of the government's equity investment in CDCP.[11]

In 1986, then President Corazon Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation No. 50, creating the Asset Private Trust that shall take title to and possession of, conserve, provisionally manage, and dispose of government assets which have been identified for privatization,[12] including the government's equity shares in PNCC.[13] In relation thereto, then President Corazon Aquino issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 59, directing all executive agencies, offices, and instrumentalities of the government to take steps to dissolve government acquired-asset corporations which had not been disposed of to the private sector.[14]

Pursuant to the directive for the privatization of PNCC, several agreements were executed between PNCC and private entities for the eventual turn-over of PNCC's tollway operations in the NLEX, SLEX, and the Metro Manila Skyway.[15]

In anticipation of PNCC's turn-over of its tollway operations to private entities and the inevitable retrenchment or retirement of PNCC's officers and employees,[16] the PNCC Board of Directors (Board) passed several resolutions (collectively, Board Resolutions) for the payment of gratuity benefits to its directors and senior officers, as follows:
(1)
Resolution No. BD-028-2005 dated March 29, 2005, authorizing the grant of gratuity pay to the outgoing directors equivalent to one month gross remuneration for every year of continuous and uninterrupted service;


(2)
Board Resolution No. BD-031-2007 dated April 25, 2007, authorizing the creation of PNCC Retirement/Resignation/Gratuity Benefit Program [(Retirement Fund)] for Directors and Senior Officers. Under this Resolution, retirement gratuity [was] granted[,] in addition to retirement benefits, to Executive Directors such as President and [Chief Executive Officer] (CEO), Executive Vice-President (EVP), Senior Vice[-]President (SVP), Corporate Secretary and Assistant Corporate Secretaries and its Corporate Secretariat Staff;


(3)
Board Resolution No. BD-043-2007 dated August 30, 2007, creating a Board of Trustees of the PNCC Retirement Fund with the power and authority to approve full and partial payments and releases of advance payments of retirement gratuity to eligible beneficiaries or entitled members of the Board and Senior Management;


(4)
Board Resolution No. BD-019-2009 dated August 27, 2009, grant cash gratuity to [petitioner] Mr. Rolando L. Macasaet, former President and Chairman of the Board and its subsidiaries, and (to petitioner] Mr. Wilfredo P. Cu, former President of PNCC and PNCC Skyway Corporation and its subsidiaries; and


(5)
Resolution No. BD-031-2008 dated November 5, 2008, granting additional powers and duties to the [PNCC] BOD to re-align and distribute savings and other income from its budget to the retirement trust fund and implement payment of regular gratuity approved under [Board] Resolution No. BD-028-2005, as amended.[17]
On the basis of the Board Resolutions, PNCC paid gratuity benefits to Arthur N. Aguilar (Aguilar), Ma. Theresa T. Defensor (Defensor), Garth Noel P.E. Tolentino (Tolentino), Jeremy Z. Parulan (Parulan), Fermin S. Lusung (Lusung), Antonio T. Vilar[18] (Vilar), Marvin V. Paule (Paule), Enrique C. Cuejilo, Jr.[19] (Cuejilo, Jr.), Roy Eduardo T. Lucero (Lucero), Ottomama Marajom[20] Benito (Benito), Guillermo N. Hernandez (Hernandez), Abraham A. Puruganan (Puruganan), Rolando L. Macasaet (Macasaet), Wilfredo P. Cu (Cu), Segundo M. Gaston (Gaston), Manuel Luis C. Antonio (Antonio), and Jaime Manuel F. Armonio (Armonio) (collectively, gratuity recipients), in the total amount of PHP 90,748,975.21, from years 2007 to 2010.[21]

After the conduct of post-audit, the COA Audit Team issued ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010)[22] dated July 8, 2011, and disallowed the grant of gratuity benefits.[23] As stated in the ND, the disbursement was disallowed because it was contrary to COA Circular No. 85-55-A dated September 9, 1985, or the Amended Rules and Regulations on the Prevention of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive or Extravagant Expenditures or Uses of Funds and Property, as well as Section 2[24] of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2002-2 dated January 2, 2002. It further stated that the disbursement was excessive and unreasonable because PNCC has been incurring losses from 2003 to 2006. In addition, the gratuity benefits were found to be extravagant, given that the members of the Board are only entitled to reasonable per diems under the law. Finally, the disbursement was disallowed for being illegal upon the finding that the Board had no authority to create the Retirement Fund.[25]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolution No. 2020-479[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA). In its Resolution, the COA affirmed with modification the Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 11-002-(2007-2010)[3] dated July 8, 2011, issued by the COA Post-Audit Team which disallowed the gratuity benefits paid by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to its directors and senior officers during the years 2007 to 2010, in the total amount of PHP 90,784,975.21.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

The COA Proper did not act with grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the disallowance of the gratuity benefits in question and holding that petitioners are civilly liable to return the disallowed disbursements.

In petitions for certiorari assailing the findings of the COA Proper in disallowance cases, it is settled that Section 7,[74] Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution and Section 2,[75] Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65, Section 1[76] of the Rules of Court limit the permissible scope of inquiry only to errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.[77]

For the COA Proper to have acted with grave abuse of discretion, petitioners must show that COA Resolution No. 2020-479 is bereft of legal or evidentiary basis, was reached in a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment, is in utter and blatant disregard of the applicable law and rules,[78] or was rendered arbitrarily or in disregard of the evidence on record.[79]

None of the foregoing circumstances are present in the case at bar. As further discussed below, the COA Proper judiciously exercised its discretion in issuing Resolution No. 2020-479. 
 
ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) has already become final and executory as to Aguilar and Lusung because they failed to observe the procedure for appeal therefrom.
 

At the outset, it must be pointed out that both Aguilar and Lusung did not sign the Appeal Memorandum,[80] which questioned ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) before the COA-CGS. Lusung appears to have initiated the appeal process only in the Petition for Review with the COA Proper[81] which he signed; meanwhile, Aguilar began his appeal process only in the present Petition, where his signature appears in the Verification and CNFS.[82] This means that both Aguilar and Lusung did not appeal the ND to the Director of the COA-CGS.

Pertinently, Sections 48 to 50[83] of PD 1445[84] (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines) provide the procedure for appeals from decisions of COA. Under Section 51 of the same law, ""[a] decision of the Commission or of any auditor upon any matter within its or his jurisdiction, if not appealed as herein provided, shall be final and executory."" Similarly, under Section 8,[85] Rule IV of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA, the decisions of COA auditors, as the authorized representatives[86] of the COA, shall become final upon the expiration of six (6) months from the date of receipt thereof, unless an appeal to the Director is taken within that period.

In view of the foregoing, ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) must already be taken as final and executory against Aguilar and Lusung, given that they both failed to appeal the ND to the COA-CGS Director within the prescribed period.

In any case, even if the Court considers Aguilar and Lusung to have timely filed their appeal, the Court finds that the COA did not act with grave abuse of discretion in holding them civilly liable to return the disallowed disbursements under the ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010), as discussed below. 
 ","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DISMISSED. The Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2020-479 dated January 31, 2020 is AFFIRMED."
"A.C. No. 13842 (Formerly CBD Case No.18-5810), May 21, 2024","ATTY. WILFREDO GARRIDO, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LORENZO G. GADON, RESPONDENT.","Garrido, Jr. seeks the disbarment of Gadon for allegedly: (1) engaging in falsehoods in an impeachment complaint filed by the latter before the House of Representatives in August 2017 and (2) filing baseless criminal cases against several Supreme Court employees. The particulars behind these allegations were summarized by the IBP-CBD as follows:[2]
[Gadon] filed [before the House of Representatives] an Impeachment Complaint dated August 2, 2017 against [then de facto] Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno [(Sereno)]. In his verification, he swore that the allegations therein [were] ""true and correct of his personal knowledge or based on authentic documents.""

In the Impeachment Complaint, [Sereno] purportedly falsified a Temporary Restraining Order [(TRO)] of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 206844-45, by tampering and altering the contents of the draft TRO sent by [Associate] Justice [Teresita] [Leonardo-De Castro], [(Justice De Castro)] and pursuant thereof, issued a ""blanket TRO.""

During the hearing before the House Committee on Justice on November 22, 2017, Gadon disclosed that it was Manila Times reporter Jamar Canlas [(Canlas)], who confirmed the said information with [Justice De Castro]. He admitted that it was not based on his personal knowledge but rather from a secondary source. He likewise admitted that he has not seen the ""draft TRO"" nor a copy of the ""blanket TRO"" issued by [Sereno].

On the same day, Justice De Castro issued a statement categorically denying [Gadon's] claim.

On November 27, 2017, [Canlas] also denied, under oath that Justice De Castro was his source or that he disclosed such to [Gadon].

It was also raised in the [Impeachment] Complaint that [Sereno] instructed a Supreme Court official to call Judges Juanita Guerrero, Amelia Fabros-Corpuz, and Patria Manalastas-De Leon, to order them not to issue warrants of arrest against the accused Senator Leila De Lima in connection with the Information filed against the latter.

However, two of the above-mentioned Judges categorically denied the allegations before the Justice Committee during the hearing on February 19, 2017 [sic].

In a Press Conference on February 22, 2018, [Gadon] made a statement that ""[i]f CJ Sereno does not resign by March 1, 2018, he will file criminal charges against other Supreme Court officials."" [Garrido, Jr.] cited:

""Talagang idadamay ko lahat. This will be the end of their careers. Lahat ng pinaghirapan, lahat mawawala. Yan ay mangyayari dahil sa katigasan ng ulo ni Sereno.""

[Garrido, Jr.] asserts that [Gadon] knows for a fact that the criminal cases he threatens to file are groundless. [Gadon] himself claims that he will file such cases because of [Sereno's] stubbornness, and not because these criminal cases are meritorious.

In an interview, however, [Sereno] said that she will never resign. Hence, on March 12, 2018, [Gadon] filed graft charges against several court officials.
In retort, Gadon filed an Answer[3] downplaying the allegations against him for being vague and unsubstantiated. Gadon maintains that the complaint failed to provide ""a clear and concise statement of facts"" that he violated any norm of legal ethics.[4] He also argued that the claim that he made perjurious statements in the impeachment complaint is not valid since Garrido, Jr. himself was never present in any of the impeachment hearings conducted by the House Committee on Justice.[5]","This resolves the administrative Complaint[1] filed before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines – Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) by complainant Atty. Wilfredo M. Garrido, Jr. (Garrido, Jr.) against respondent Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon (Gadon).","The Court modifies the recommendation of the IBP-BOG.

Gadon Committed Perjury in the
Verification in his Impeachment
Complaint

We agree with the finding of the IBP-CBD that Gadon committed perjury in the verification of his impeachment complaint[14] against Sereno, a former de facto Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

During the November 22, 2017 hearing of the House Committee on Justice, it was revealed that one of the allegations in the impeachment complaint—i.e., that the then Chief Justice Sereno falsified a TRO of the Supreme Court in G.R. Nos. 206844-45[15]—was not based on Gadon's personal knowledge or on any authentic records. Worse, it was further uncovered that such allegation was only founded on hearsay or based merely on what Gadon was told by a journalist. This is attested by the Records of Proceedings for the said hearing no less:
....
REP. LEACHON. Because for so long a time, I've been wondering how these things all happen that's why we have this hearing, Atty. Gadon.

MR. GADON. Yes, Your Honor.

REP. LEACHON. Yeah, I worked with ... I worked actually with ... at the Supreme Court for about four years of my life during the time that I was at my law school. Ang trabaho dyan...pagka well of course they will have their meeting division or [en] banc and then, of course, it is a [collegial] body and they will meet and they will agree on a certain point before the issuance of a resolution. Yung pinagkukwento mo doon sa mga... sa complaint mo na ... na merong desisyon iyong en banc, may desisyon iyong division meron nang napagkasunduan tapos iba and lalabas sa resolusyon. Those are internal matters, Atty. Gadon, of which no other party except members of the Supreme Court would have knowledge as to the occurrence of such meeting and as to the decision.

So, as for you to conclude, later on, that if the resolution that was released was entirely different from the decision that was reached by the en banc or by the division at nagkakaroon nga ng falsification in the sense that the group actually participated in an event of which iba ang nangyari pagkatapos and under the Revised Penal Code that is actually falsification.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Lorenzo G. Gadon GUILTY of Gross Misconduct which is punishable by DISBARMENT. However, in view of his disbarment in In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles, the said penalty shall no longer be imposed but shall nevertheless be recorded in his personal file pursuant to Canon VI, Section 42 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Accordingly, and in view of his previous disbarment, a FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed upon the respondent, which shall be paid within a period not exceeding three months from receipt of this Decision in accordance with Canon VI, Section 41 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is further directed to submit to this Court proof of payment within 10 days from said payment.

In ND Nos. 11-027 (10) and 11-039, the grant of Transportation Allowance for CY 2010 and 2011, respectively, to job order contractors was disallowed because of the lack of approval from the Office of the President (OP). Additionally, the NDs cited that the grant was not in accordance with the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) executed between the PhilHealth, ROV and the PhilHealth Insurance Corporation PHIC Employees Association because what was provided for in the CNA is the provision of shuttle services, and not cash assistance.[24]

The benefits in the rest of the assailed NDs were disallowed for lack of legal basis.[25]","This resolves the Special Civil Action for certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64, with prayer for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) filed by petitioner Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) assailing the December 20, 2017 Decision No. 2017-422[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (CP) and its September 24, 2018 Resolution[3]. The COA CP affirmed with modification the June 10, 2014 Decision[4] of the COA Regional Office No. V Office of the Regional Director (COA ROV), which affirmed the 19 Notices of Disallowance (ND) addressed to the PhilHealth Regional Office No. V (ROV) covering the payment of various benefits and allowances to job order contractors and project-based contractors in the total amount of PHP 4,146,213.85.","The Petition is partly meritorious.

At the outset, the Court's review of COA decisions on a Rule 64 petition is limited to a review of jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion. The Court's intervention is justified only when it is clearly shown that the COA acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[55]

As held in Miralles v. Commission on Audit,[56] grave abuse of discretion exists when the assailed decision or resolution is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism, thus:
The Constitution vests the broadest latitude in the COA in discharging its role as the guardian of public funds and properties by granting it ""exclusive authority, subject to the limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties."" In recognition of such constitutional empowerment of the COA, the Court has generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to enforce. Only when the COA has clearly acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction has the Court intervened to correct the COA's decisions or resolutions. For this purpose, grave abuse of discretion means that there is on the part of the COA an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim[,] and despotism.[57] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted)
Absent this breach, the Court generally sustains the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally created, such as the COA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce.[58]
.
Here, the Petition failed to prove that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the assailed NDs. Nevertheless, the Court must clarify the liability of the individuals identified in the NDs in light of jurisprudential guidelines.

PhilHealth's position is anchored on what it believes is its fiscal autonomy granted under Republic Act No. 7875.[59] According to PhilHealth, this grant has been confirmed by Opinions of the OGCC, letters from the OP, and legislative deliberations.[60]

However, the view that PhilHealth enjoys absolute authority to determine the grant of benefits and allowances to its employees had already been consistently rejected by the Court.

In the 2023 case of PhilHealth v. COA,[61] the Court had outlined case law settling the issue of the limits of the fiscal independence of PhilHealth. In the 2016 case of PhilHealth v. COA,[62] and reiterated in 2021 in PhilHealth v. COA,[63] the Court held that while Republic Act No. 7875 granted PhilHealth the liberty to fix the compensation of its personnel, it does not necessarily mean that PhilHealth has an unbridled discretion to issue any and all kinds of allowances, circumscribed only by the provisions of its charter.[64]

The Court thus held that PhilHealth is bound by the provisions of the Salary Standardization Law;[65] Presidential Decree No. 1597 on the requirement of Presidential approval for the grant of allowances, honoraria, and other fringe benefits;[66] Public Sector Labor-Management Council Resolution No. 4, Series of 2022 issued by the DBM, which requires qualifications to the grant of CNA incentives by government-owned and controlled corporations, such as PhilHealth;[67] and other prevailing rules and regulations issued by the OP and the DBM.[68]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision in COA Decision No. 2017-422, dated December 20, 2017, and the Resolution in COA CP Case No. 2014-572, dated September 27, 2018, are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATIONS, as follows:

"G.R. No. 259862, May 21, 2024 ","SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","In 2012, the SSS-Luzon North Cluster received three Notices of Disallowance (ND) in relation to CNA incentives paid to its rank-and-file employees between 2005 and 2008, specifically:

ND No.
Benefit Subject of Disallowance
Amount (PHP)
2012-001-(2008)[4]
Additional CNA Incentives for 2008
3,626,505.53
2012-002-(2010)[5]
CNA Incentives from January 2005 to December 2008

Additional CNA Incentives for 2008
464,264.34
TOTAL
PHP 20,703,254.08

The COA CAR disallowed the CNA incentives due to the following reasons:

Firstly, the grant of incentives was contrary to Sections 5.7 and 7.1 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2006-01[7] in that there were excessive accruals of cash incentives for the years 2006 to 2008, which were then made the basis for paying additional cash incentives after revaluation of further savings made in 2009.[8]

Secondly, there were violations of Section 2 of Public Sector Labor-Management Council (PSLMC) Resolution No. 02, Series of 2003,[9] and of Sections 5.0, 6.1, 6.1.2 and 7.1.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-01.[10] In the disallowed grant, all the savings out of the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) was the basis for computing the 80% allocation for cash incentives although these were not conclusively generated out of cost-cutting measures, as one of the conditions for the grant of cash incentives, and as identified in the CNA.[11]

Lastly, the COA Audit Team found that Section 6.1.3 of the DBM BC No. 2006-01[12] was also not followed because the maximum allocation of 80% out of the savings from MOOE was made the basis for computing cash incentives even if benefits in other forms were already being enjoyed by the rank-and-file employees.[13]

In addition to the three reasons stated, the COA CAR also disallowed the grant of CNA incentives for the year 2005 in ND No. 2012-002-(2010) because this form of incentive was not provided in the CNA[14] for this period, and thus, contrary to Section 5.1 of the DBM BC No. 2006-01.[15] Similarly, the conditions for the grant set in Section 3 of PSLMC Resolution No. 02, Series of 2003,[16] were not met in 2005 and 2007, which resulted in the irregular or excessive disbursement.[17]

The assailed NDs also required the return of the disallowed amounts by the recipients, the certifying officers, and the approving officers. Other than the payees, the persons determined to be liable in the various transactions were Luis V. Olais, for approving the payment; Myrna C. Lacsamana, for certifying that the supporting documents are proper and legal; and Daniel T. Caput, for certifying that funds are available.[18]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 filed by the Social Security System (SSS) seeking to annul and set aside the December 17, 2021 Decision[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (CP) in Decision No. 2021-425. The COA CP approved the April 5, 2016 Decision[3] of the COA Cordillera Administrative Region (COA CAR) in Decision No. 2016-014, which affirmed the disallowance of the grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentives to the rank-and-file employees of the SSS-Luzon North Cluster, while modifying the total disallowed amount on account of computational error.","The Petition must fail.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that Rule 64 petitions assailing COA decisions are limited to a review by this Court of jurisdictional errors or claims of grave abuse of discretion.[41] This regard by the Court for the decisions of administrative authorities, especially those which are constitutionally created, such as the COA, is underpinned by the doctrine of separation of powers, as well as the recognition of the presumed expertise in the laws these administrative bodies are entrusted to enforce.[42]

The Court explained in Madera v. COA[43] that grave abuse of discretion exists when the assailed decision or resolution is not based on law and the evidence, but on caprice, whim, and despotism, thus:
The Constitution vests the broadest latitude in the COA in discharging its role as the guardian of public funds and properties. In recognition of such constitutional empowerment, the Court has generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to enforce. Thus, the Constitution and the Rules of Court provide the remedy of a petition for certiorari in order to restrict the scope of inquiry to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the COA. For this purpose, grave abuse of discretion means that there is, on the part of the COA, an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim[,] and despotism.[44] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted).
This case must then be weighed against the same standard.

The Court finds that this Petition failed to prove that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the assailed NDs. Hence, the Petition must be dismissed.

The disallowances by the COA of the CNA Incentives were proper
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Decision of the Commission on Audit in Decision No. 2021-425, dated December 17, 2021, is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION in that Daniel T. Caput is not solidarily liable to refund the disallowed amounts."
"G.R. No. 261459, May 20, 2024","XXX,* PETITIONER, VS.

That on or about the month of March 2013 and persisting up to the present time, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit economic abuse upon the person of [AAA], his legal wife, and their child, [BBB], a minor, by then and there deliberately depriving them of financial support for the purpose of controlling his wife's conduct, that is to compel his wife to allow him to regularly visit their child as a condition for the grant of support, thereby depriving them of their basic needs, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended parties.","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions dated May 31, 2021,[2] and April 18, 2022,[3] in CA-G.R. CV No. 114839.

In the assailed issuances, the CA directed the execution pending appeal of the Decision[4] dated October 28, 2019, rendered by Branch xxxx, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03746-CR insofar as it ordered XXX (petitioner) to extend future monthly support to AAA (private respondent) and their child BBB in the amount of PHP 15,000.00.","The petition has no merit.

In partially granting the motion for issuance of a writ of execution, the CA cited Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court in that an execution pending appeal requires three conditions; first, the prevailing party must file a motion therefor; second, there must be a good reason for the issuance of a writ of execution; and third, the good reason must be stated in a special order.[33]

In turn, the ""good reason"" relied upon by the CA in the first assailed Resolution was Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. It reads:
SEC. 4. Judgments not stayed by appeal. — Judgments in actions for injunction, receivership, accounting and support, and such other judgments as are now or may hereafter be declared to be immediately executory, shall be enforceable after their rendition and shall not, be stayed by an appeal taken therefrom, unless otherwise ordered by the trial court. On appeal therefrom, the appellate court in its discretion may make an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting the injunction, receivership, accounting, or award of support.

The stay of execution shall be upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as may be considered proper for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party.
To recall, the CA explained that there are two types of support in the RTC Decision – future monthly support amounting to PHP 15,000.00 and support in arrears or the unpaid accumulated monthly support of PHP 15,000.00 ""to be reckoned from March 2013 up to the present."" Pursuant to its discretion, the CA held that the immediate execution of the judgment on future support was with a good reason. However, as to the support in arrears, the CA found that private respondent's justification, i.e., dire financial need, was not a good reason to execute the judgment pending appeal.[34] As stated in the first assailed Resolution:
Thus, the part of the RTC's judgment ordering [petitioner] to give monthly support of Php15,000.00 is immediately executory and enforceable as early as the rendition of said, judgment. Section 4, Rule 39, above-quoted constitutes enough ""good reason"" for an execution pending appeal for the grant of future support.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED.

SC-22926, SC-22927, SC-22928, SC-22929, SC-22930, and SC-22931.

In Criminal Case Nos. SC-22927, SC-22930, and SC-22931, the RTC found JJJ (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, defined and penalized under Republic Act No. (RA) 9208,[5] as amended by RA 10364.[6]

In Criminal Case Nos. SC-22926, SC-22928, and SC-22929, the RTC dismissed the charges of Child Pornography, defined and punished under RA 9775,[7] in relation to RA 10175,[8] against the accused-appellant.","The appeal is dismissed.

Well settled is the rule that an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review on any question including one not raised by the parties.[56] As such, an ""appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.""[57]

With the foregoing, the Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction of Qualified Human Trafficking under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, and sustains the dismissal of the charges for Child Pornography under RA 9775, in relation to RA 10175, on the ground of double jeopardy.

However, Child Pornography is an offense separate and distinct from Qualified Human Trafficking and is not subsumed in the latter offense. The Court will elucidate hereunder for the guidance of the bench and bar. 
 
The CA is correct in affirming accused-appellant's conviction of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364
 

Accused-appellant was charged with three (3) counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons penalized under Section 4(a) RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364. Section 3(a) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, defines Trafficking in Persons as follows:
SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act: 
 
(a)
Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other fo1ms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.



The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
On such score, Section 4(a) of the same law provides:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts: 
 
(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation[.]
In light of the foregoing, the elements of Trafficking in Persons are: (1) the act of recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders; (2) the means used include by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person; and (3) the purpose of trafficking includes the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.[58]","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED.

DEMETRIO AYDALLA AND HEIRS OF JOSE AYDALLA, RESPONDENTS.","The case involved agricultural lots designated as Lot Nos. 4064-A and 4064-B (collectively, subject lots) with areas of about 2.2040 and 0.3002 hectares, respectively, located at Kilikao, Daraga, Albay, which were subjected to the coverage of the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) Program.[4]

Records reveal that in 1972, petitioner acquired the subject lots, together with other lots having an aggregate area of 63 hectares, from Porfirio Vda. De Los Baños, Inc.[5]

Sometime in 1973, petitioner applied for the conversion of the subject lots into non-agricultural use, and thus, identified the tenants who would be given disturbance compensation and home lots in lieu of displacement or ejectment. Eight tenants, among whom were Demetrio Aydalla (Demetrio) and Jose Aydalla (Jose) (collectively, respondents), filed a case for specific performance before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudicatory Board (DARAB) for determination of disturbance compensation. The case was resolved in 1984 in their favor. Consequently, Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) Nos. 0-5798 and 0­-0526697 and Emancipation Patent (EP) Nos. 148144 and 018918 were issued in favor of Demetrio and Jose, respectively.[6]

The details of the EPs are as follows:


Lot No.
EP No.
Status
1. Demetrio
4064-A
A-148144
--
2. Jose
4064-B
A-018918
Registered on February 4, 1989.[7]

On February 18, 1998, petitioner filed a Petition[8] for declaration of nullity of CLT Nos. 0-5798 and 0-0526697 and EP Nos. 148144 and 018918 (nullity case) with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) – Agrarian Reform Regional Office for Region V (DARRO-V) against respondents.

On October 15, 1998, petitioner filed an amended petition[9] against Demetrio and the heirs of Jose and sought the following reliefs:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed that after due investigation and hearing, decision be made:

a. Declaring as nullity OLT Nos. 0-05798 and 0-0526697 issued to respondents Demetrio Aydalla and Jose Aydalla;

b. To cancel emancipation patents Nos. 148144 and 018918, for Demetrio Aydalla and Jose Aydalla, respectively, generated by the Provincial Agrarian Reform Office of the DAR, Province of Albay, and to declare the same as without force and effect;

c. Declaring the status of respondents as recognized tenants-beneficiaries of the DAR to be null and void and without force and effect;

d. That a declaration of non-tenancy relationship between Respondents and Petitioner be issued.
Likewise, petitioner prays for such other relief as may be just and equitable under the premises.[10] (Emphasis omitted)
Thereafter, Demetrio filed a Motion to Dismiss[11] dated November 5, 1998, on the grounds of prescription, DARRO-V's lack of jurisdiction, and res judicata.

According to Demetrio, the issues raised in the petition had already been settled in CAR Case No. 782[12] between Luis Los Baños, the previous owner, and Ceferino Aydalla, their father. Considering that the petition was filed one year after the EPs were issued and registered in their name, Demetrio argued that the case no longer concerned the implementation of agrarian reform matters, and thus, it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DARAB.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Under Rule 45)[1] which seeks the reversal of the Decision[2] dated June 15, 2017, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Likewise assailed in the petition is the CA's Resolution[3] dated January 29, 2018, denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.","The petition is bereft of merit.

The Order dated May 9, 2000, is merely an interlocutory order that could not have fully disposed of the nullity case


A reading of the fallo of the Order dated May 9, 2000, reveals that Regional Director Andres merely gave due course to the petition for declaration of nullity of CLTs, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Order is hereby issued GIVING DUE COURSE to the petition for the declaration of nullity of CLTs issued to tenants covering lot 4064-A and lot 4064-B.

SO ORDERED.[47] (Emphasis supplied)
To stress, the above fallo only states that the Order was issued ""giving due course"" to the petition, not that it was granting the petition or nullifying the CLTs and EPs in question.

It is settled that an interlocutory order deals with preliminary matters, i.e., the Motion to Dismiss and the Opposition to Motion to Dismiss. In other words, it is not a judgment on the merits. The Order dated May 9, 2000, being interlocutory, cannot attain finality because, by its very nature, it may be modified or rescinded upon sufficient grounds at any time before final judgment;[48] likewise, it is not subject to execution. Consequently, the Order dated July 28, 2000, which affirmed in toto the Order dated May 9, 2000, is likewise only an interlocutory order and thus not subject to appeal.[49]

Although Regional Director Andres stated that the subject lots are no longer within the sphere of the OLT Program, it is also worth noting that nowhere in the body of the Order dated May 9, 2000, did Regional Director Andres declare that respondents' CLTs and EPs are null and void.

It is settled that where there is conflict between the fallo and the body of a decision, it is the fallo that controls regardless of what appears in the body of the decision as it is the fallo that ""invests rights upon the parties, sets conditions for the exercise of those rights, and imposes corresponding duties or obligation.""[50]

To the Court's mind, it is immaterial whether Regional Director Andres intended to nullify respondents' CLTs and EPs when he issued the Order dated May 9, 2000, for it is the fallo, not the body of the decision, that is the subject of an order of execution. Hence, respondents aptly pointed out that there is nothing to execute on the Order dated May 9, 2000, because it contains no order of cancellation of the CLTs and EPs.[51]

Assuming arguendo that the Order dated May 9, 2000, is a judgment on the merits, the petition still fails.

There are four exceptions to the doctrine of immutability of judgment: (1) the correction of clerical errors; 2) nunc pro tunc entries which causes no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) supervening events.[52]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated June 15, 2017, and the Resolution dated January 29, 2018, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 137366 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. Nos. 264919-21, May 20, 2024","GLORIA MARIS SHARK'S FIN RESTAURANT, INC., PETITIONER, VS. PACIFICO Q. LIM, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Pacifico Q. Lim (Lim) is engaged in construction, as well as in the restaurant business. He avers that prior to the establishment of Gloria Maris, he already concocted the name ""Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant."" He further claims that he had already thought of the logo, which shall be a fin of a shark enclosed in a plate of irregular shape.[10]

Thus, in 1993, Lim allegedly offered a proposal to the owners of a restaurant located on the premises of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), which, as Lim claimed, was about to go out of business.[11]

After several meetings, ""Gloriamaris Shark's Fin Restaurant Inc."" was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 26, 1994,[12] by the following incorporators: Dominador B. Menguito (Menguito), Pedro O. Manalo, Lorenzo Q. Dy, Edmundo L. Tan, and respondent Lim.[13]

Gloria Maris avers that a graphic artist was hired to submit a sample drawing of the Gloria Maris trademark. After the approval of the said trademark, the Board of Directors entrusted to Lim the trademark's registration with the IPO.[14]

However, it was only in 2005 or more than 10 years after Gloria Maris' registration with the SEC, that three trademarks were registered with the IPO: ""GLORIA MARIS WOK SHOP & DESIGN"" on August 28, 2005,[15]""GLORIA MARIS DIMSUM KITCHEN WITH LOGO AND DESIGN"" on August 28, 2005,[16] and ""GLORIA MARIS SHARK'S FIN RESTAURANT AND LOGO"" on October 31, 2005.[17] All these trademarks, however, were registered in the name of Lim as the owner.

Thereafter, Lim ventured into franchising where he was able to franchise the concept of Gloria Maris restaurant to several companies.[18]

Gloria Maris allegedly discovered, that contrary to what they had thought, the registration of the trademark entrusted to Lim was registered in his own name and after he had left the company.[19]

On December 4, 2009, Gloria Maris filed separate petitions to cancel Trademark Registration Nos. 4-2004-009149,[20] 4-2004-009150,[21] and 4- 2004-009151.[22]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant, Inc. (Gloria Maris), assailing the Decision,[2] dated March 18, 2022, and the Resolution,[3] dated December 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 162466, 162467 and 162468. The assailed Decision reversed the separate Decisions, all dated August 6, 2019, issued by the Office of the Director General (ODG) of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in Appeal Nos. 14-2012-0009,[4] 14-2012-0010,[5] and 14-2012-0011.[6]  The assailed Decision reinstated the separate Decisions, all dated February 23, 2012, of the Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA) of the IPO in Decision Nos. 2012-32,[7] 2012- 33,[8] and 2012-34.[9]","In its Petition, Gloria Maris asserts that the later use and registration by Lim is unlawful.[41] Gloria Maris insists that Lim is not the owner of the ""Gloria Maris"" mark and trade name.[42] Finally, it claims that it is not estopped from asking for the cancellation of Lim's registrations since the subject trademarks were obtained in bad faith.[43]

In his Comment,[44] Lim maintains that he is the owner of the trademarks. He echoes the ruling of the CA that the evidence adduced by Gloria Maris failed to overcome the presumption that he is the prima facie owner of the trademarks.[45] Moreover, laches had set in against Gloria Maris.[46]

Gloria Maris, in its Reply,[47] counters that Lim's registration is only prima facie evidence of his ownership of the registered trademarks. Hence, the said trademarks may still be canceled since these were made in bad faith. Therefore, Gloria Maris is not estopped from assailing its validity.[48]

Gloria Maris further argues that the evidence that  it presented constituted substantial evidence to establish that it owns the trademark ""Gloria Maris.""[49]

The Petition is meritorious.

Before delving into the merits, the Court notes that the apparently confusing similarity between Gloria Maris' trade name and the trademarks registered by Lim is not at issue in this case, as aptly determined by the ODG.[50] The sole issue in this case is the propriety of Lim's registration of the subject marks.

As a general rule, a petition for review on certiorari filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should only and strictly involve questions of law. However, intellectual property disputes, especially when it comes to trademarks, are highly factual in nature and require a review of the evidence presented by the parties. Moreover, among the exceptions to the rule is when, as in the present case, the findings of the ODG and the CA are conflicting.[51]

In relation to this, proceedings before the IPO are administrative in nature. Therefore, they are governed by the principles and doctrines of the law on administrative adjudication.[52] Consequently, the quantum of proof required in intellectual property cases is substantial evidence, or evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Furthermore, administrative agencies are not bound by the technical rules of procedure that are usually applicable in courts of law.[53] Indeed, the primordial purpose of the rules of procedure is to facilitate the attainment of justice, rather than its frustration. It should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of any party.[54]

On appeal before the ODG, Gloria Maris submitted, among others, its Bureau of Internal Revenue Certificate of Registration under the name of ""Gloriamaris Shark's Fin Restaurant,"" the registration date of which is dated March 17, 1997.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant, Inc. is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 18, 2022, and the Resolution, dated December 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 162466, 162467 and 162468 are REVERSED.

Consequently, the following Certificates of Registration in the name of Pacifico Q. Lim are ordered CANCELLED:
1. Certificate of Registration No. 4-2004-009149 for GLORIA MARIS WOK SHOP AND DESIGN;

2. Certificate of Registration No. 4-2004-009150 for GLORIA MARIS DIMSUM KITCHEN WITH LOGO; and

"A.C. No. 11020, May 15, 2024","INOCENTES DOMIE BALANSAG, JOEL MOLEJON, AND BONIFACIO CATARATA, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. DAVE DUALLO AND ATTY. RODOLFO DACALOS, JR., RESPONDENTS.","The instant Complaint is an offspring of a 1997 labor case filed by complainants against Timothy Bakeshop, a sole proprietorship. In 1999, the labor arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision in favor of complainants. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the LA ruling with modification, increasing the monetary awards due to complainants. The Rule 65 Petition filed by Timothy Bakeshop to the Court of Appeals was dismissed in 2008. Records reveal that Timothy Bakeshop no longer appealed to the Court; hence, the NLRC ruling attained finality.[2]

Respondents, then entered their appearance at the execution stage as counsels of Timothy Bakeshop before the LA wherein they filed a Motion to Stay Execution of Judgment and to Declare the Proceedings of the Case Null and Void. Said Motion was denied. Aggrieved, respondents, on behalf of Timothy Bakeshop, filed an Appeal to the NLRC but the same was also denied. Respondents then filed a Rule 65 Petition for Certiorari before the CA, which was, however, likewise denied in a Decision dated July 31, 2015. In its ruling, the CA held, among others, that ""it is worth reiterating that [Timothy Bakeshop, through respondents] had apparently employed dilatory tactics by filing numerous pleadings and motions notwithstanding the fact that the case had already attained finality."" The CA then went on to say that ""Under the circumstances, [Timothy Bakeshop's] recourse cannot but be regarded as dilatory move. It must be borne in mind that an abuse of the judicial process is a blatant mockery of justice.""[3]

Citing the foregoing observations of the CA, complainants filed the instant administrative disciplinary case against respondents, praying that: (a) they be spared from the endless delays and suffering in their quest for justice; and (b) respondents be properly disciplined and stopped from endlessly subverting the administration of justice through abuse of judicial processes.[4]

For their defense, respondents averred that despite the filing and the pendency of the actions taken by respondents, complainants have succeeded in having the Decision executed and fully satisfied. The real properties of respondents' clients were levied, auctioned, and the titles of the lots were ultimately transferred to the complainants names. Hence, it was wrong for complainants to say that respondents' actions delayed or impeded the execution of the Decision. Further, respondents insisted that Jane Kyamko (Kyamko), the owner of Timothy Bakeshop, went to them for help as to the alleged forged Complaint by complainants. According to Kyamko, complainants confessed to her that they did not actually file the Complaint in the labor case. Respondents believed that Kyamko had a valid grievance.[5]","For the Court's resolution is an administrative Complaint[1] dated October 15, 2015 filed by complainants Inocentes Domie Balansag, Joel Molejon, and Bonifacio Catarata (complainants) against respondents Atty. Dave D. Duallo (Duallo) and Atty. Rodolfo Dacalos, Jr. (Dacalos; collectively, respondents) for alleged abuse of the judicial process and for blatantly mocking the administration of justice by filing baseless motions.","The Court affirms and adopts the findings and recommendations of the IBP.

While it is true that respondents indeed owe fidelity to the cause of his client and is expected to serve the latter with competence and diligence, professional rules, however, impose limits on a lawyer's zeal and hedge it with necessary restrictions and qualifications.[10] Lawyers are required, under the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.[11] Furthermore, lawyers are required to observe fairness and obedience to the law.[12]

In this regard, case law instructs that a lawyer does not have an unbridled right to file pleadings, motions, and cases, as he or she pleases[13] as limitations thereto may be inferred from, inter alia, Canon II, Sections 2 and 5, and Canon III, Sections 2 and 7, all of which respectively read:

ARGUELLES, RESPONDENTS.","In early 2017, TRANSCO allegedly encroached upon the subject properties and removed the existing structures and trees, claiming that these were prohibited within a 40-meter range of the transmission line. It likewise asserted ownership over the properties, contending that such acquisition was necessary for the improvement of the electricity transmission system.[11]

Consequently, the property owners resorted to filing the Complaint to compel TRANSCO to exercise its power of eminent domain and to pay just compensation over the subject properties.[12] In response, TRANSCO filed its Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim[13] seeking the dismissal of the Complaint for lack of merit.

Following this, the property owners filed a Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752. They averred that TRANSCO should be ordered to deposit to the court a provisional amount equivalent to the current zonal valuation of the subject properties from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). TRANSCO then filed its Comment/Opposition alleging that the Complaint was not covered by Republic Act No. 10752. Assuming that the law would be applicable, TRANSCO argued that the requirement of depositing 100% of the value of the property should be based on its value at the time of taking.[14]

Meanwhile, a Motion for Partial Withdrawal of Complaint was filed by the heirs of Rosario P. Plata, which the RTC later granted in its October 12, 2020 Order.[15]

In its October 13, 2020 Resolution,[16] the RTC granted the Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752 and ordered TRANSCO to deposit to the Clerk of Court, an amount equivalent to 100% of the subject properties' value based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, in the amount of PHP 138,448,000.00. TRANSCO moved for reconsideration but was denied by the RTC.[17]

Afterwards, TRANSCO filed a Manifestation with Motion to Archive and, later, a Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party. In both Motions, TRANSCO prayed that NGCP be impleaded as an indispensable party and requested that the case be archived pending NGCP's inclusion.[18]

In its July 26, 2021 Resolution,[19] the RTC denied both Motions for lack of merit, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the defendant's Motion to Archive and Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party are hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Accordingly, let the initial presentation of plaintiffs' evidence be set on August 20, 2021 at 10:00 in the morning before the Hearing Commissioner, Atty. Roy Mikhail V. Galvez.
 ","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) challenging the Resolution[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed TRANSCO's Petition for Certiorari solely on procedural grounds, and the Resolution[3] which denied its Motion for Reconsideration. The prior Petition sought to reverse the Resolution[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) denying TRANSCO's Motion to Archive and Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party, as well as its Resolution denying its Motion for Reconsideration.

The present controversy arose from a Complaint[5] filed by Clemente P. Untiveros, spouses Jose and Teodora Pagcaliwagan, Lucila M. Plata, the heirs of Juan and Geronima Torres, spouses Leonisa and Natalio Lopez, spouses Bernardo and Anita Pagcaliwagan (collectively, Untiveros et al.), along with the heirs of Rosario P. Plata, for inverse condemnation under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, in connection with Republic Act No. 10752,[6] against TRANSCO before the RTC. They claimed to be the registered owners of seven parcels of land located in Barangay Bucal, Batangas City (subject properties) which were affected by the Batangas-Makban 230KV Transmission Line owned by TRANSCO.[7]

TRANSCO is a government-owned and controlled corporation created under Republic Act No. 9136,[8] tasked with the operation and maintenance of the nationwide power transmission system. Significantly, these functions were turned over to the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) on January 15, 2009, following the enactment of Republic Act No. 9511[9] and the execution of the Concession Agreement[10] among the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), TRANSCO, and NGCP.","We find merit in this Petition.

Time and again, this Court has underscored that the right to file a special civil action of certiorari is neither a natural right nor a fundamental aspect of due process.[37] It is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, but is issued solely based on judicial discretion.[38] Hence, an individual who seeks a writ of certiorari must strictly adhere to the provisions of the Rules and the law.[39] Undoubtedly, the observance of these procedural rules is paramount, as these were designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases and to address the issue of delays in the administration of justice.[40]

Nevertheless, if strict adherence to the rules of procedure would hinder rather than aid in the administration of justice, especially in instances where the circumstances of the case underscore the need for substantive justice, this Court may relax the application of these procedural rules in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.[41] To put it simply, this Court has the discretion to relax the application of procedural rules for compelling reasons to alleviate a litigant from an injustice that is disproportionate to their procedural lapses.[42]

After a perusal of the records, it is evident that petitioner failed to comply with certain procedural requirements in its Petition before the CA, particularly Rule 46, Section 3[43] in relation to Section 2,[44] and Rule 65, Section 4[45] of the Rules of Court. However, considering the exceptional circumstances brought about by the pandemic, along with the substantial merits of the case, this Court deems it proper to relax the rules and proceed to resolve the case on its merits.

At the crux of this controversy is whether the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's Motion to Archive and the Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party.

Turning Our attention first to the denial of the Motion to Archive, it is relevant to revisit Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 89-2004,[46] which echoed the guidelines in OCA Circular No. 7-A-92[47] regarding the archiving of cases, thus:
II. CIVIL CASES

In ci vii cases, the court may, motu proprio or upon motion, order that a civil case be archived only in the following instances:

(a) When the parties are in the process of settlement, in which case the proceedings may be suspended and the case archived for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days. The case shall be included in the trial calendar on the day immediately following the lapse of the suspension period.

(b) When an interlocutory order or incident in the civil case is elevated to and is pending resolution/decision for an indefinite period before a higher court which has issued a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.

(c) When defendant without fault or neglect of plaintiff, can not be served with summons within six (6) months from issuance of original summons.
From the foregoing, We concur with the keen observations of the RTC that the ground raised by petitioner, i.e., the pending inclusion of an indispensable party 1s not among those instances that would warrant the archiving of civil cases. Given this fact, this Court affirms the RTC's denial of the Motion to Archive.

Next, to address the matter regarding the denial of the Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party, it becomes imperative to ascertain if NGCP is an indispensable party in the subject case for inverse condemnation.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated June 16, 2022 and March 16, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 171508 are REVERSED. Let the case be REMANDED to the court of origin for the inclusion of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines as an indispensable party, and to proceed with the case with dispatch."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioners were charged with homicide in relation to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code for the death of Oscar Duran (Oscar). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 23rd day of March 2011, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one another, threaten victim OSCAR DURAN y DEL CARMEN then 76 years old, with the infliction upon his person of a wrong amounting to a crime that is, by attempting to hit him with a steel chair and, thereafter, shouting invective or slanderous words such as 'Putang ina mong matanda ka, ididimanda kita', 'Matanda ka na walang pinagkatandaan', and such other words of similar import, which thus threatened and caused irritation or annoyance on the said victim; that as a direct, natural and logical consequences of such threatening acts and vexations or annoying words uttered by the herein accused against Oscar Duran, the latter suffered heart seizure or Cardiorespiratory arrest which directly caused his untimely death.

Contrary to law.[6]
On arraignment, petitioners pleaded not guilty.[7] Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.","The barking of a dog in the dead of night caused a heated verbal tussle between neighbors, ending in the death of one and the incarceration of four. The family of the departed seeks retribution, while those incarcerated plead innocence.

The Court is once again tasked to determine whether guilt beyond reasonable doubt has been established in these consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] emanating from the same factual backdrop in appeal of the Decision[2] (Assailed Decision) and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa (RTC), finding petitioners Shiela Marie Cafranca y Bello (Shiela), Raymark Velasco (Mamark), Carlito Orbiso y Abique (Carla), and Ma. Josephine Cafranca y Bello (Majo) (collectively, petitioners) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide under Article 249 in relation to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code.[5]","At the outset, it is noted that the consolidated Petitions raise questions of fact, which are generally beyond the purview of an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[40] The issue of whether the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners committed the alleged felonious acts and that said acts resulted in the death of Oscar requires Us to re-examine the evidence on record. Clearly, these are questions of fact.

Concededly, jurisprudence has established exceptions to said rule, such as when the trial court ignored, misunderstood, or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would alter the outcome of the case.[41] Petitioners insist that this case falls under said exception.[42]

The contention is well-taken.

Praeter Intentionem

Criminal liability is incurred by any person committing a felony although the wrongful act be different from that which is intended. This is embodied in Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, which provides:
Criminal Liability. — Criminal liability shall be incurred:

1. By any person committing a felony (delito) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended.
In order that a person may be criminally liable for a felony different from that which the offender intended to commit, it is indispensable that (a) that a felony was committed; and (b) that the wrong done to the aggrieved person be the direct consequence of the crime committed by the offender.[43]

One who commits an intentional felony is responsible for all the consequences which may naturally or logically result therefrom, whether foreseen or intended or not. The rationale of the rule is found in the doctrine, el que es causa de la causa es causa del mal causado, or the person who is the cause of the cause is the cause of the evil caused.[44] Thus, the Court has held that even if the victim is suffering from an internal ailment, there is criminal liability if the act of the accused is the efficient cause of death, accelerated the death, or the proximate cause of death.[45]

Guided by the foregoing principles, We now resolve the present case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are GRANTED. The Decision dated February 28, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 38832 are MODIFIED.

GUT-OMEN, EDWARD B. LIKIGAN, SOLEDAD THERESA F. WANAWAN, JEROME M. FALINGAO, ABDON A. IMINGAN AND RONALD C. KIMAKIM, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","In his Complaint dated January 24, 2007, Harry C. Dominguez (Dominguez), then a gubernatorial candidate in the Mountain Province, charged the now-deceased Maximo B. Dalog,[7] then Governor of Mountain Province, Pagteilan, Kollin, Gut-omen, Likigan, Emilio B. Pinangga, and Wanawan with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and violation of Republic Act No. 9184, relative to the procurement of one unit of Mitsubishi van in the amount of PHP 1,000,000.00.[8] Dominguez averred that the bidding was rigged since no public bidding actually took place, there was no posting on the Government Electronic Procurement System (GEPS), the vehicle was purchased from an unauthorized dealer, and there was no transparency in the procurement because there was no consistency in the identification of the source of the funds. The case was docketed as OMB-L-C-07-0106-A.

In its Resolution[9] dated March 25, 2009, Graft Investigation & Prosecution Officer Judy Anne Doctor-Escalona recommended the dismissal of the charges against therein respondents. As evidenced by the documents submitted by the complainant, the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found that a public bidding had, in fact, taken place for the procurement of the vehicle in question. Relative to the posting requirement on GEPS, the OMB, however, found that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) failed to post on GEPS, however, there was no internet access or service provider in Bontoc, Mountain Province, at the time the bidding was conducted, thus, preventing them from complying with this requirement. As for the source of the funds, since the National Government deposited the funds in the general fund account of the provincial government of Mountain Province, the indication of ""general fund"" as the source of the funding was not erroneous. With respect to the allegation that the vehicle was overpriced, the OMB held that complainant failed to support the charge since he did not provide canvass sheets indicating the specifications of the items which should match those items subject to the alleged overpricing. More, the quotation submitted by complainant from Motorplaza, Inc. in the amount of PHP 781,000.00 was only for the Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van, excluding expenses for the ambulance equipment and accessories. The OMB further found that complainant failed to prove that Ronhil Trading, Inc. was an unauthorized dealer. Ultimately, the OMB concluded that complainant failed to specify the acts indicating corrupt practices to prove that there was indeed a violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[10]

Thereafter, Dominguez filed another Letter-Complaint dated February 5, 2007 requesting the National Bureau of Investigation-Cordillera Administrative Region (NBI-CAR) to investigate the allegations of anomalous transactions regarding the purchase of one unit of Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van (subject vehicle), the same vehicle subject of the investigation of the OMB.

Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 requires the following elements: (1) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) he or she must have acted with manifest partiality, or evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) his or her action caused undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.[68]

Public officer requirement

There is no issue as to the presence of the first element. Except for Kimakim, accused-appellants are all public officers. As for Kimakim though, he is a private individual who allegedly received unwarranted benefit from the questioned transaction and acted as a co-conspirator of his co-accused.[69]

Manifest partiality and evident bad faith


Anent the second element, the Court has held that:
The second element provides the different modes by which the crime may be committed, that is, through ""manifest partiality,"" ""evident bad faith,"" or ""gross inexcusable negligence."" In Uriarte v. People, this Court explained that Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 may be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa, as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. There is ""manifest partiality"" when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. ""Evident bad faith"" connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. ""Evident bad faith"" contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. ""Gross inexcusable negligence"" refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.[70] (Emphasis supplied)
These three mental elements are distinct from one another and the existence of any of them suffices to support a conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.

The Sandiganbayan held that accused-appellants acted with manifest partiality when they proceeded with the procurement process and awarded the contract to Kimakim despite alleged irregularities in the bidding procedure. They purportedly violated Republic Act No. 9184 when they specified the brand name and model of the vehicle in the procurement documents, when they deviated from the purpose of the procurement, and when they revised the procurement documents upon discovery of the deviation from the original intent of the procurement.[71]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeals are GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated March 24, 2023 and Resolution dated June 13, 2023 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-17-CRM-1495 are REVERSED. Accused-appellants THEODORE B. MARRERO, NENITA D. LIZARDO, HELEN K.

GALAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 30, ILOILO CITY, ILOILO, RESPONDENT.","In an Information[2] dated March 9, 2019 filed before Branch 38, RTC of Iloilo City, Galan and co-accused Praud Joan L. Animas (Animas) were charged with violating Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 7th day of March 2019, in the City of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, with deliberate intent and without any justifiable motive, conspiring, confederating, and helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, knowingly, and criminally dispense, sell, trade, distribute, deliver, and give away to poseur buyer IO1 REMSON TIU one (1) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet (marked as ""BB-PA 3/7/19""), containing 0.1689 gram of white crystalline substance which tested positive for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, or Shabu, a dangerous drug, per Chemistry Report No. PDEAROVI­ DD019-094[,] without being authorized by law or the Dangerous Drugs Board to dispense, sell, trade, distribute, deliver, or give away the same, in consideration of THREE THOUSAND Pesos ([PHP 3,000.00]), using a previously subscribed one thousand peso bill, bearing Serial No. AJ851281, and two (2) pieces one thousand peso boodle bills, as buy-bust money, which were likewise recovered from the person, possession, and control of accused PRAUD JOAN ANIMAS y LOPEZ alias ""Lab-lab"" upon the arrest of both accused","This administrative case stemmed from a Letter[1] dated March 8, 2019, written by Executive Judge Victor E. Gelvezon (Executive Judge Gelvezon) informing the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) of the March 7, 2019 arrest of respondent Gerson O. Galan (Galan), Utility Worker I, Branch 30, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Iloilo City, for selling dangerous drugs.","The Court agrees with the findings and recommendations of the JIB. Galan's participation in illegal drug activities, wherein he was charged and convicted pursuant to a buy-bust operation, constitutes grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

Jurisprudence defines misconduct as ""a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.""[18] In Grave Misconduct, as distinguished from Simple Misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of established rules, must be manifest and established by substantial evidence.[19]

On the other hand, acts may constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service when they tarnish the image and integrity of the respondent's public office.[20] It refers to acts or omissions that violate the norm of public accountability and diminish — or tend to diminish — the people's faith in the Judiciary.[21]

In this case, Galan was caught red-handed participating in illegal drug activities during a buy-bust operation, and found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of committing the offense punishable under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165, viz.:
Section 12. Possession of Equipment, Instrument, Apparatus and Other Paraphernalia for Dangerous Drugs. - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess or have under his/her control any equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug into the body . . .
It goes without saying that Galan demonstrated unlawful behavior and a manifest intent to violate the law in performing the criminal act that he was convicted of. Further, the fact that he was an employee of a court necessarily tasked with the adjudication of drug-related cases, while himself being involved in criminal drug operations, adversely and gravely affected the image and integrity of the court to the general public, in which he was known to be an employee. Undoubtedly, Galan committed grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

The Court reminds Galan that the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel. Thus, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and every one in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice. As front liners in the administration of justice, court personnel should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service, and in this light, are always expected to act in a manner free from reproach. Any conduct, act, or omission that may diminish the people's faith in the Judiciary should not be tolerated.[22]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Gerson O. Galan GUILTY of gross misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. He is hereby ordered to PAY a FINE of PHP 150,000.00, with FORFEITURE of his retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits. Likewise, he is PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED from re­employment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and controlled corporation or government financial institution.

This Decision shall take effect immediately upon respondent Gerson O. Galan's receipt of a copy of the same. Respondent Gerson O. Galan shall inform this Court in writing of the date he received a copy of this Decision.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Court Administrator for attachment to the respondent Gerson O. Galan's official records."
"G.R. No. 255074, May 14, 2024","NILDA LAGUNA SALAZAR, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT (COA), AND MA. MILEGUAS M. LEYNO, IN HER CAPACITY AS REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF COMMISSION ON AUDIT REGION III, RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in 2019, the Municipality of Mayantoc advertised an Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid in relation to the Project. This was posted in a newspaper of provincial circulation, as well as in a conspicuous place at the premises of the municipality for 14 continuous days.[5]

In response to the invitation, three contractors submitted their letters of intent and applications for eligibility. The Abstract of Bids,[6] which was certified correct by the members of the Bids and Awards Committee of the Municipality of Mayantoc, reflected the names of the bidders/contractors, their respective bid amounts and bonds, and the remarks of the Bids and Awards Committee, as follows:
 
Name of Bidder/Contractor
Bid Amount
Bidder's Bond
JQG Construction and Supplies	PHP 24,990,264.56	PHP 1,250,000.00
Delos Reyes Construction	PHP 24,999,141.21	PHP 1,250,000.00
DAMICO Builders	PHP 24,998,744.91	PHP 1,250,000.00

On November 19, 2009, the Bids and Awards Committee issued Resolution No. 76,[7] declaring JQC Construction as the bidder with the lowest calculated responsive bid for the Project following post qualification. By virtue of Resolution No. 43-2009[8] dated November 20, 2009, the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Mayantoc ratified the resolution of the Bids and Awards Committee that the public bidding for the Project was conducted in order and pursuant to Republic Act No. 9184.[9]

Then Mayantoc Municipal Mayor Tito G. Razalan (Mayor Razalan) issued on November 20, 2009 the corresponding Notice of Award[10] in favor of JQG Construction. Thereupon, the Municipality of Mayantoc issued a Notice to Proceed,[11] informing JQG Construction that the Contract Agreement[12] between them had been approved and that it may commence the construction of the Project.

During the administration of Mayantoc Mayor Iluminado E. Pobre (Mayor Pobre), Audit Team Leader Jean M. Daliva (Daliva) submitted to him Technical Evaluation Report No. 2010-04-042 dated April 12, 2011 in connection with the Project.[13] In the report, the audit team noted several deficiencies, for which Daliva requested the submission of several documents to facilitate its technical evaluation and inspection. She also requested the concerned official/s identified therein to comment on the observations.[14]

In compliance with Daliva's request, Mayor Pobre instructed Engineer Rodolfo F. Corpuz (Engr. Corpuz), the municipal engineer and Bids and Awards Committee Chairperson, to submit the documents requested by the COA.[15]

As it happened, a Notice of Suspension[16] was issued to halt the payment due to JQG Construction in the amount of PHP 23,048,230.15 for the construction of the Project in view of the local government unit's submission of incomplete supporting documents. The Notice of Suspension named the persons responsible for the incomplete submission, as follows:","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside Decision No. 2018-212[2] and the Resolution[3] in Decision No. 2020-386 of respondent Commission on Audit (COA).

The subject controversy involves a Contract Agreement[4] entered into between the Municipality of Mayantoc, Tarlac (Municipality of Mayantoc) and JQG Construction and Supplies (JQG Construction) for the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park in Mayantoc, Tarlac (Project).","At the vortex of the instant Petition is this pivotal query—Did the COA correctly disallow the payment to JQG Construction relative to the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park?

This Court answers in the affirmative. Still and all, the exceptional circumstances surrounding the case strongly impel the Court to remand it to the COA for the determination of the adjusted disallowed amount.

The issuance of an audit letter or an Audit Observation Memorandum is an initiatory step in the investigative audit to determine the propriety of disbursements made. If after an in-depth investigation, there is a finding that the transaction should be suspended or disallowed, a Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance or Notice of Charge shall be issued. It is the Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance or Notice of Charge that becomes final and executory, absent any motion for reconsideration or appeal.[46] Necessarily, the findings and conclusions in the notices may vary from the initial observation contained in the audit letter or Audit Observation Memorandum. In light of the audit investigation, an additional person may be held liable, the amount to be suspended or disallowed may change, or the nature of participation of the persons initially held responsible may be modified.

In the present controversy, Salazar was initially held responsible in the Notice of Suspension as the municipal treasurer ""[f]or paying the disbursements.""[47] However, in the Notice of Disallowance, she was held liable for her role as a Bids and Awards Committee member ""[f]or declaring the winning bidder, JQG Construction and Supplies, as the Bidder with the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid for the construction of Mayantoc Memorial Park despite the deficiencies noted.""[48] As enunciated, this modification is a necessary consequence of the audit investigation. In fact, other Bids and Awards Committee members not initially named in the Notice of Suspension were similarly identified as liable in the Notice of Disallowance. The variation in Salazar's nature of participation under the Notice of Suspension and Notice of Disallowance is of no moment; it is not tantamount to either a denial of due process or equal protection of the laws.

In Saligumba v. Commission on Audit,[49] the Court held that ""[d]ue process is complied with 'if the party who is properly notified of allegations against him or her is given an opportunity to defend himself or herself against those allegations, and such defense was considered by the tribunal in arriving at its own independent conclusions'.""[50] The essence of due process is the fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard or to explain one's side.[51]

Here, Salazar actively participated in the proceedings before the COA. She appealed the Notice of Disallowance to the COA regional director and filed her Petition for Review with the COA Proper. Clearly, she was afforded the opportunity to present her side in every stage of the proceedings. Despite the variance in the Notice of Suspension and the Notice of Disallowance, she was nevertheless afforded all opportunity before COA Regional Office No. III and the COA Proper to state her case against any liability as a member of the Bids and Awards Committee. By virtue of her active participation in the proceedings, any defect in the Notice of Suspension and the Notice or Disallowance had effectively been waived.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED IN PART. The January 31, 2018 Decision No. 2018-212 and the January 31, 2020 Resolution in Decision No. 2020-386 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

The case is REMANDED to respondent Commission on Audit for the determination of the disallowed amount, as reduced by the reasonable value of the services rendered by the payee/contractor. Petitioner Nilda G. Salazar, along with the other persons named liable in the Notice of Disallowance, are declared solidarily liable for the adjusted disallowed amount."

TEHANO-ANG, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 1, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TAGUM CITY, DAVAO DEL NORTE, RESPONDENT.","The Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Tagum City filed four Informations[15] indicting Garcia as well as King Paul Auditor (Auditor), Dexter Auditor, Leo Q. Perez, Jr., Rodrigo L. Marquez, Jr., Maita R. Palma, Mercylun T. Escobido and Ruby Imma G. Labajo, as officers, traders, managers, employees, and/or agents of Rigen Marketing, for the crime of syndicated estafa under Presidential Decree No. 1689,[16] section 1, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 315, paragraph 2 (a)[17] of the Revised Penal Code. The cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 25236 to 25239 and raffled to Branch 1, Regional Trial Court of Tagum City, Davao Del Norte, presided by Judge Ang.

Subsequently, on November 25, 2019, Judge Ang issued an Order[18] which granted the prosecution's urgent motion for the issuance of commitment order for Auditor and directed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG)-Camp Crame, Quezon City, to turn him over to the jurisdiction of the court.[19]

Thereupon, Auditor filed an urgent motion to hold in abeyance his transfer from the CIDG-Camp Crame to the jurisdiction of the court, which was, however, denied in an Order dated December 3, 2019.[20]

Given that some of the accused were at large, Judge Ang issued the Order[21] dated December 20, 2019, which relevantly reads:
The rest of the Accused might not have been arrested; but since they are involved in all these cases; they should all appear for the Prosecution and the Court to hear their respective Defense, in order to fast track the proceeding[;] as they are all free to appear, even if there is a pending Warrant to Arrest them; for their voluntary appearance will be the basis for this Court to grant their temporary liberty by posting a bailbond, even if the charge against them is non-bailable; provided that they will not jump bail and shall comply with their commitment to be present every time their cases will be called; for any way the concerns of the private complainants herein is only about the money they used to invest to acquire higher rate of profit.","No less than the Constitution states that a member of the judiciary ""must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity and independence. ""It is, therefore, highly imperative that a judge should be conversant with basic legal principles. When a judge displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he or she erodes the public's confidence in the competence of our courts. Once a heavy shadow is cast on a judge's moral, intellectual and attitudinal competence in view of their transgressions, then he or she can no longer don the judicial robe and perform the functions of a magistrate. The administration of justice cannot be entrusted to one who would readily ignore and disregard the laws and policies enacted by the Court to guarantee justice and fairness for all.[1]

For this Court's adjudication is the Complaint[2] of Rico John Colorines Garcia (Garcia), praying for the imposition of proper sanctions against Honorable Judge Virginia D. Tehano-Ang (Judge Ang) and that she be considered retired for all legal intents and purposes[3] in view of her violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct,[4] namely: Rules 1.01,[5] 1.02,[6] 1.03,[7] 2.01,[8] 2.02,[9] 3.01,[10] 3.02,[11] 3.07,[12] 3.08,[13] and 3.12.[14]","The Court adopts the factual findings and the recommendation of the JIB.

Prefatorily, it bears accentuating that an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for the aberrant or irregular acts of judges where a judicial remedy is available, such as a motion for reconsideration, an appeal, or a petition for certiorari. The acts of judges in their judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. Simply put, an inquiry into the correctness of a judge's official act is undeniably judicial in nature and is best settled through the available appropriate judicial remedies under the Rules of Court, and not by way of an administrative complaint.[57]

In the case at bench, the JIB infallibly considered Judge Ang's acts of granting the amendment of the Information, issuing a warrant of arrest without requiring Rosenda to file comment, and denying the oral manifestation to file a petition for change of venue, as judicial in nature and therefore cannot be properly probed into in this administrative complaint.

Besides, given that such acts were performed within the bounds of law and applicable rules, the same cannot be the subject of disciplinary liability. To be sure, the Rules of Court do not require that every accused be afforded the right to comment before a judge can amend the Information to include him or her thereon, or issue a warrant for their arrest. Moreover, the denial of the oral manifestation to file a petition for change of venue, is proper given that Judge Ang had no authority to rule on it. No less than the Constitution decrees that the power to order a change of venue or place of trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice is lodged with the Supreme Court.[58]

On this score, the explication of the Court in Tallado v. Judge Racoma[59] anent the interplay between disciplinary cases against judges and their judicial functions, is illuminating, viz.:
It is well-settled that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions against judges are not complementary or suppletory to, nor a substitute for, these judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. For, obviously, if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against him at all. Besides, to hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming he has erred, would be nothing short of harassment and would make his position doubly unbearable. To hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. It is only where the error is tainted with bad faith, fraud, malice, or dishonesty that administrative sanctions may be imposed against the erring judge.[60]
Thus, there are two occasions when judges cannot be found administratively liable for acts performed in connection with their official duty: (1) Whenever they act within the bounds of the law and the applicable rules; and (2) Whenever they act erroneously but the error is made in good faith. Upon this point, only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty and corruption, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned.[61]

Certainly, Judge Ang cannot be sanctioned thereof as her foregoing acts were in accordance with the rules and were not even flawed.

Still and all, the same conclusion does not hold true anent the other charges in this Complaint. Judges cannot be subject to any liability—civil, criminal, or administrative—for any of their official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as they act in good faith. As adumbrated above, judicial errors can only be sanctioned if tarnished with fraud, dishonesty and corruption, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice.[62]

The other charges questioning Judge Ang's official acts, although judicial in nature, fall within the ambit of an administrative proceeding as they are not simple errors of judgment. Judge Ang appallingly made a mockery of the rules of procedure in handling the instant criminal cases. Evidently, she deviated from the basic rules and settled jurisprudence that she devised her own guidelines. Judge Ang's repeated disregard of the applicable laws and rules manifest her gross ignorance of the law which the Court cannot tolerate.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court ordains as follows:
1.	
The Complaint against respondent Hon. Virginia D. Tehano-Ang, former Presiding Judge, Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Tagum  City, Davao del Norte, is RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter; and

On post-audit, the Audit Team Leader and the Supervising Auditor of SRWD issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2012-008(11) finding that the payment of the additional allowances and bonuses to the employee-recipients and the members of its BOD are without legal basis. In response, SRWD explained that the questioned allowances and bonuses were paid in good faith, after securing authorization from the Local Water Utility Administration (LWUA) and the DBM.[9]

On November 21, 2012, the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor issued ND Nos. 12-001-101(11)[10] and 12-002-101(11).[11]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court filed by Engr. Numeriano M. Castañeda, Jr. (Castañeda, Jr.), in his capacity as General Manager of San Rafael Water District (SRWD), on his own behalf and on behalf of the other SRWD officials and employees (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Commission on Audit (COA).

The assailed COA issuances affirmed the Notices of Disallowance Nos. (NDs) 12-001-101(11)[4] and 12-002-101(11) both dated November 21, 2012,[5] which (1) respectively disallowed the payment of (a) additional allowances and bonuses to employees hired after December 31, 1999, amounting to PHP 857,340.75, and (b) year-end financial assistance and cash gift to the SWRD Board of Directors (BOD) for the period of January 1 to December 31, 2011, amounting to PHP 239,000.00, and (2) found petitioners liable for the refund of the disallowed amounts.","The petition lacks merit.

Propriety of the Disallowance

Petitioners impute grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA for upholding ND Nos. 12-001-101(11) and 12-002-101(11) when the subject allowances were in keeping with a valid DBM authority and LWUA issuances.

The contention deserves scant consideration.   
 
I.
Rice Allowance, Grocery Allowance, Medical Allowance, and Year-End Financial Assistance granted to the employee-­recipients.

DBM-CCC No. 10-99 was issued pursuant to the authority given to the DBM under the first sentence of Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758. Sub-paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5[54] of DBM-CCC No. 10-99 allows the grant of benefits, other than those specifically enumerated in the first sentence of Section 12, conditioned upon the incumbency requirement and the actual receipt of such allowances and benefits while being incumbents. Among those listed are rice subsidy and medical benefits. However, in the instant case, the employee-recipients are not incumbents as of July 1, 1989.

The Court has consistently construed the qualifying date to be July 1, 1989, or the effectivity date of Republic Act No. 6758, in determining whether an employee was an incumbent and actually receiving the non­integrated allowances so that he may be entitled to continuously receive them.[55] Accordingly, the Garcia Letter, which authorized the grant of the disallowed benefits to employees hired after December 31, 1999, is erroneous and cannot be relied upon. Director Garcia cannot, by his own interpretation, change the meaning and intent of the law. In Torcuator v. Commission on Audit,[56] the Court emphatically ruled that the ""DBM is constrained to abide by the explicit provision of the law that July 1, 1989 is the reckoning point, pursuant to Republic Act No. 6758, when allowances or fringe benefits may be granted to incumbent officers and employees.""[57] After the said date, the general rule of integration shall apply to allowances and benefits.

Stated differently, the Garcia letter cannot be invoked to change the specific date provided by the law. The implementing rules and regulations of a law cannot extend the law or expand its coverage, as the power to amend or repeal a statute is vested in the legislature.[58] The Court likewise observed that the Garcia Letter lacked any explanation as to why December 31, 1999, was prescribed as the reckoning date.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The January 29, 2018 Decision in Decision No. 2018-188 and January 24, 2022 Resolution in Resolution No. 2022-118 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED.

The Notice of Disallowance Nos. 12-001-101(11) and 12-002-101(11), both dated November 21, 2012, are hereby MODIFIED in that the payees are liable to the extent of the amount they received, while Engr. Numeriano Castañeda, Jr., and Ms. Marivel Suarez, acting as the authorizing officer and certifying officer, respectively, remain solidarily liable after deducting the actual amounts refunded by the employee-­recipients."

HONORABLE ERWIN VIRGILIO P. FERRER, EXECUTIVE JUDGE AND PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 20, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, NAGA CITY, CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENT.","In his Order[3] dated October 19, 2020, Judge Intia inhibited himself from handling Criminal Case Nos. 2019-0822 and 2019-0823 titled ""People v. Inda"" and his footnotes bore the following narrative, viz.:
When a judge maligns and speaks bad of another judge specially about cases pending in the sala of the latter, and instigates a lawyer or any person to go against a fellow judge, and the aspersion of everything except goodness and righteousness of the judge maligned reaches the litigants especially those who lost their cases decided by the judge maligned, the latter is placed in higher risk of all possible harm that can be thought of. I had been hearing for the past years that this judge has been maligning me but I kept my peace and instead prayed that he will realize the danger of what he is doing against me especially that he is doing these out of anger, malice, and envy, without any constructive purpose but to destroy me. I know because several persons to whom he confided told me, and even his staff speaks. But as he continues to put me down, his enemies multiply due to his personality/character manifested in his actions, some of which are as follows: 1) He shouted and lambasted a policeman witness in open court and ordered him to sit on the Judge chair while having trial, the Lady Prosecutor was already in tears when the fury of the judge subsided; 2) In a loud and offensive voice, he humiliated and insulted a Barangay Captain during a hearing. In these two and similar incidents, the victims and even the prosecutors were persuaded not to complain against this Judge. But just months ago, a Lady staff of the Judge complained to the Chief Justice, Supreme Court against this Judge who lambasted, shouted, insulted and humiliated her during a staff meeting. The Lady reported these criminal and damaging actions of the Judge to the police and her affidavit was subscribed before the Prosecution Office. All these incidents happened, are verifiable and are common knowledge in the legal circle, but the third incident came to my knowledge because I was informed by my staff and the affidavit and letter circulated through the different chat groups of the Court employees. He is so powerful that in a stroke of his pen, his Lady Staff was assigned to another Branch of RTC, Naga City. Just last week, I was informed by my staff that another letter circulated in relation to the Complaint of the Lady staff of this Judge, and she told me that since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects as the author of the circulation. I tried to reach out and talk to this Judge for several times but I was refused. This is so disturbing on my part, I must talk, my Faithful Breast can no longer tolerate these matters.

A week ago, a fellow Lady Judge in this jurisdiction was ambushed, thanks GOD she survived but her aide was seriously wounded. This Judge (referred to in the first paragraph of this footnote) due to his temper, sudden outburst of emotions, and constant use of offensive language, has humiliated, embarrassed and angered many persons. God forbid, if his victims complain against him and worst, if something harmful happens to him, to quote my staff – 'since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects.' I and this Judge were friends and I cherish our friendship despite all these things he did and is doing to me. In fact, my in-laws and his parents are close friends in their lifetime. Friendship is the reason why for so many years that this Judge has been renting a commercial space in the commercial building of my in-laws, no increase in monthly rental was collected from him, unlike other lessees. At one time, I told him that we will get the insurance of our cars from him, and yes we were given big discount. It was only last year when this Judge transferred the venue of his business to his house. (Proofs are the lease contract signed by this Judge and receipts of payment of his monthly rentals of his commercial space.) I have known [of] these activities of this Judge for a long time but it is for his good and his family to just remain silent. (Canon of Judicial Ethics, Rule 5.02 – A judge shall refrain from financial and business dealings that tend to reflect adversely on the court's impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of judicial activities, or increase involvements with lawyers or persons likely to come before the court. A judge should so manage investments and other financial interests as to minimize the number of cases giving grounds for disqualification; Art. 14 – The following cannot engage in the commercial profession either in person or by proxy, nor can they hold any direct administrative or economic position in commercial and industrial associations within the limits of his districts, provinces, or towns in which they discharge their duties: xxx judges and officials of the department of public prosecution in active service xxx) But I must break my silence now. In the world of business there are competitors and dissatisfied clients. To quote my staff again – ""since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects.""[4] (Emphasis supplied)

To reiterate, Judge Intia accused Executive Judge Ferrer (ret.) of unbecoming conduct for the latter's alleged outbursts in open court against court personnel Valencia during a staff meeting.

"G.R. No. 257516, May 13, 2024","DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE­-REVENUE INTEGRITY PROTECTION SERVICE (DOF-RIPS), PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, FREDERICKS. LEAÑO, AND JEREMIAS C. LEAÑO,• RESPONDENTS.","The DOF-RIPS filed a Complaint before the OMB against Spouses Leaño, who are both employees of the Bureau of Customs (BOC),[6] for violations of the above-cited criminal laws and for Serious Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct. The DOF-RIPS alleged that pursuant to the conduct of a lifestyle check on Spouses Leaño, it was discovered that they made untruthful, misleading, and incomplete declarations in their joint annual Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN). Specifically, there was allegedly a false declaration of a house and lot located in Montefaro Village, Imus City, Cavite (Montefaro property) in their 2006 to 2018 SALNs. Furthermore, the DOF-RIPS observed that Spouses Leaño indicated in their 2007 to 2011 SALNs that the acquisition cost of said property was PHP 650,000.00, yet in their 2006 and 2012 to 2018 SALNs, they indicated the acquisition cost at only PHP 535,000.00.[7]

The DOF-RIPS also alleged that Spouses Leaño failed to declare a house and lot located in Golden Villas Subdivision, Imus City, Cavite (Golden Villas property) in their 2009 to 2018 SALNs, and a business interest over Framille General Merchandise (Framille) in their 2012 SALNs.[8]

The DOF-RIPS pointed out that per verification with the Land Registration Authority, no real property was registered in the names of Spouses Leaño or of any of their children. There was, however, a record of tax payments covering the Golden Villas property, with Spouses Leaño as the declared owners of the property. No similar record existed insofar as the Montefaro property was concerned.[9]

As to Spouses Leaño's alleged business interest over Framille, the DOF-RIPS averred that the documents gathered from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Permits and Licenses Division of Imus, Cavite revealed Spouses Leaño's ownership of Framille.[10]","The instant Petition[1] for Certiorari (Petition) seeks to set aside the Joint Resolution[2] dated October 1, 2020 of public respondent Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), which dismissed the criminal complaints of petitioner Department of Finance-Revenue Integrity Protection Service (DOF-RIPS) against private respondents Spouses Frederick and Jeremias Leaño (Spouses Leaño), for violations of Section 7 of Republic Act No. 3019,[3] Section 8 of Republic Act No. 6713,[4] and Article 171(4) on Falsification of Public Document and Article 183 on Perjury of the Revised Penal Code. The Petition also assails the Joint Order[5] dated February 9, 2021 of the OMB, which denied the DOF-RIPS' Consolidated Motion for Reconsideration.","After a careful study of the allegations and the records of this case, the Court resolves to dismiss the Petition for failure to establish that the OMB committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

As a general rule, the Court does not interfere with the OMB's exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers, and respects the initiative and independence inherent in said office.[23] In addition, the Court defers to the sound judgment of the OMB in recognition of the fact that a finding of probable cause is an executive determination and a highly factual inquiry which the OMB is best suited to make.[24] Where there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion, however, the OMB's act cannot escape judicial scrutiny under the Court's own constitutional power and duty.[25]

Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The OMB's exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner that must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.[26] For certiorari to prosper, mere disagreement with the findings of the OMB is not sufficient. There must be a showing that it conducted its proceedings in such a way that amounted to a virtual refusal to perform a duty under the law.[27]

In ascribing grave abuse of discretion against the OMB, the DOF-­RIPS maintains that Spouses Leaño are criminally liable for making false declarations in their SALNs. The DOF-RIPS highlights the tax declarations of the properties of Jeremias and Josielyn, which show that the Montefaro property was under the name of Josielyn, while the Golden Villas property was under the name of Jeremias. Hence, according to the DOF-RIPS, it was untruthful for Spouses Leaño to declare the Montefaro property in their SALNs, while at the same time, omitting the Golden Villas property therefrom. The DOF-RIPS points out that the tax declarations are evidence of ownership, against which the barangay certifications pertaining to Spouses Leaño's occupancy of the Montefaro property should bear no weight.[28] 

Additionally, the DOF-RIPS insists that the fact that the business of Spouses Leaño in Framille did not take off in 2012 should not be sufficient reason to not declare said business in their 2012 SALNs. At the very least, the lack of actual business operation may be better threshed out in a trial.[29]

The DOF-RIPS likewise argues that the elements of Falsification of Public Documents are present when Spouses Leaño intentionally made misdeclarations, inconsistencies, and non-declarations in their SALNs, despite their known legal obligation to disclose the truth.[30]

In the same vein, for repeatedly asserting falsehoods under oath in their SALNs even if they were required by law to declare true, detailed, and complete inventories of their properties, the DOF-RIPS argues that there is probable cause that Spouses Leaño committed multiple counts of perjury.[31]

The foregoing arguments, however, do not persuade and miserably fail to show how the OMB acted whimsically, arbitrarily, or capriciously in rendering its assailed Joint Resolution and Joint Order.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court DISMISSES the Petition for Certiorari for lack of merit. The Joint Resolution dated October 1, 2020 and the Joint Order dated February 9, 2021 of the Office of the Ombudsman are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 206517, May 13, 2024 ","STABLEWOOD PHILIPPINES, INC. [FORMERLY ROLLS­ROYCE PHILIPPINES, INC., (FORMERLY ORCA ENERGY, INC.)], PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Stablewood is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[5]

From January 1998 to July 2007, Stablewood, then carrying the name ""Orca Energy, Inc."" (Orca), was registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Region No. 8, Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 50 (South Makati). Later, it moved to RDO No. 47 (East Makati) due to a change of address.[6]

On April 7, 2006, Stablewood electronically filed its Annual Income Tax Return (ITR) for TY 2005, which reflected CWT overpayment in the amount of PHP 76,245,344.99.[7] On the said ITR, Stablewood marked the choice ""To be issued a Tax Credit Certificate"" in relation to its unutilized CWT for TY 2005.[8]

Subsequently, Stablewood carried over the tax overpayment indicated in its TY 2005 Annual ITR in its Quarterly Income Tax Returns for the first, second, and third quarters of the TY 2006.[9]

On November 24, 2006, Stablewood filed an administrative claim for refund of its excess CWT for TY 2005 in the amount of PHP 65,085,905.82 with BIR Revenue Region No. 8.[10] Thereafter, Stablewood filed its Annual ITR for TY 2006 electronically on April 2, 2007, and manually on April 12, 2007. In its TY 2006 Annual ITR, Stablewood indicated that it did not carry­over its unutilized CWT from TY 2005.[11]

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) failed to act on Stablewood's administrative claim for refund. Hence, Stablewood filed a Petition for Review before the CTA on November 13, 2007.[12]

In its Answer, the CIR argued that taxes paid and collected are assumed to be in accordance with laws and regulations, and not refundable or creditable if the taxpayer fails to demonstrate that the tax was erroneously or illegally collected. The CIR added that it was incumbent on Stablewood to show that it complied with the provisions of Sections 204(C) in relation to Section 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, which enumerate the requirements for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for taxes erroneously paid or illegally collected. The CIR argued that Stablewood failed to discharge its duty to prove that it is entitled to a refund or tax credit.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated October 8, 2012 and the Resolution[3] dated March 22, 2013 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc (EB) in CTA EB Case No. 794, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated January 31, 2011 of the CTA Third Division (CTA Division) in CTA Case No. 7704, denying petitioner Stablewood Philippines, Inc.'s (Stablewood) claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) of creditable withholding tax (CWT) for taxable year (TY) 2005 in the amount of PHP 65,085,905.82.","The Petition has no merit.

Under Section 76 of the NIRC, there are two options available to the corporation whenever it overpays its income tax for the taxable year: (1) to carry over and apply the overpayment as tax credit against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities of the succeeding taxable years (also known as automatic tax credit) until fully utilized (meaning, there is no prescriptive period); and (2) to apply for a cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate within the prescribed period. Such overpayment of income tax is usually occasioned by the over-withholding of taxes on the income payments to the corporate taxpayer.[51]

Relatedly, the last paragraph of the said provision lays down the irrevocability rule, to wit:
SEC. 76. Final Adjustment Return. – Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either:

(A) Pay the balance of tax still due; or

(B) Carry-over the excess credit; or

(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be.

In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid during the year, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry-over and apply the said excess quarterly income taxes paid against the income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such options shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor[.] (Emphasis supplied)
Interpreting the above provision, the Court has held that a ""perfunctory reading of the law unmistakably discloses that the irrevocable option referred to is the carry-over option only. There appears nothing therein from which to infer that the other choice, i.e., cash refund or tax credit certificate, is also irrevocable. If the intention of the lawmakers was to make such option of cash refund or tax credit certificate also irrevocable, then they would have clearly provided so. In other words, the law does not prevent a taxpayer who originally opted for a refund or tax credit certificate from shifting to the carry-over of the excess creditable taxes to the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. However, in case the taxpayer decides to shift its option to carryover, it may no longer revert to its original choice due to the irrevocability rule. As Section 76 [of the NIRC] unequivocally provides, once the option to carry over has been made, it shall be irrevocable. Furthermore, the provision seems to suggest that there are no qualifications or conditions attached to the rule on irrevocability.""[52]

Thus, considering the express provision of Section 76 of the NIRC, the fact that Stablewood indicated in its TY 2005 Annual ITR that its choice was to refund/obtain a tax credit certificate for its unutilized CWT for TY 2005 does not make this choice irrevocable. The subsequent carry-over of Stablewood's unutilized CWT for TY 2005 to the first to third quarters of TY 2006—which, to recall, is admitted by Stablewood, but which it claims to be a mistake or inadvertently done—was allowable. Moreover, as discussed above, once a taxpayer changes its choice from refund/tax credit certificate to carry-over of unutilized tax, the choice of carry-over becomes irrevocable.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated October 8, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 22, 2013 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 794 are hereby AFFIRMED."

MANILA CORDAGE COMPANY (MCC) AND MANCO SYNTHETICS, INC. (MSI) RESPONDENTS.","The Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (OLALIA) is a legitimate labor organization, with petitioners serving as its local chapters in MCC and MSI. On the other hand, MCC and MSI are domestic corporations engaged in the rope-making business. Since MCC and MSI had no exclusive bargaining agent, OLALIA filed two Petitions for Certification Election before the DOLE Regional Office IV. The Petitions were granted, paving the way for the conduct of certification elections on January 27, 2016.[7]

In response to the conduct of certification elections, MCC and MSI filed formal protests to challenge the results, claiming that the voters in the elections were not their employees, but of independent contractors, Worktrusted Manpower Services Cooperative (WMSC) and Alternative Network Resources Unlimited Multi-Purpose Cooperative (ANRUMC). The Med-Arbiter granted the protests, which led to the filing of a Memorandum of Appeal by petitioners before the DOLE Secretary (certification election case).[8]

Meanwhile, pursuant to the visitorial and enforcement powers of the Regional Director of DOLE Regional Office No. IV-A (DOLE Regional Director) under Article 128 of the Labor Code, joint assessments were conducted in the premises of MCC and MSI on April 26, 2016, where workers of WMSC and ANRUMC were deployed. From its assessment, the DOLE Regional Director issued a separate Notice of Results[9] for each of the companies, but noted the same observations for both:
1.)	
NO CWW NOTIFICATION SUBMITTED TO DOLE
- NON-PAYMENT OF OT & ADDITIONAL; HOLIDAY PREMIUMS
2.)	
NON-PRESENTATION OF PAYROLLS [sic] RECORDS AND DTRS FROM OCTOBER 2014 TO THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT;
3.)

7.)	
POOR WORKING ENVIRONMENT: HEAT AND NOISE POLLUTION[10]
The results of the inspection prompted MCC and MSI to submit a Memorandum explaining that they were not able to provide the workers' records as they were employees of WMSC and ANRUMC. They also lamented the fact that they were not given more time to coordinate with the service cooperatives to obtain the required records.[11]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Manco Synthetic Inc.-Employee Labor Union-Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (MSI-ELU-OLALIA) and Manila Cordage Company-Employees Labor Union-Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (MCC-ELU-OLALIA) (collectively, petitioners), seeking to reverse the Amended Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA). The assailed rulings reversed the earlier CA Decision,[4] which denied the Petition for Certiorari filed by Manila Cordage Company (MCC) and Manco Synthetics, Inc. (MSI) for lack of merit. The assailed CA rulings set aside the Resolutions[5] of the Office of the Secretary of Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and held that no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties.[6]","The present Petition for Review stems from a special civil action for certiorari filed by respondents before the CA, to assail the supposed grave abuse of discretion of the DOLE Secretary, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in finding the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the parties. Thus, for this Court to resolve the instant petition, it is necessary to determine whether the CA properly resolved the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the DOLE Secretary's Decision, and not based on whether the latter's Decision on the merits of the case was strictly correct.[40]

In addition, since this Court is not a trier of facts, only questions of law raised in the present petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are reviewable. As such, ""[f]actual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction especially when these are supported by substantial evidence."" Only when the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the quasi-judicial agency is this Court constrained to review and resolve the factual issue [to] settle the controversy.[41]

Here, the factual findings of the CA and the DOLE Secretary were uniform in that WMSC and ANRUMC were discovered to be involved in labor-only contracting and not legitimate contractors, and that respondents were observed to be exercising the right to control and supervise the performance of duties of the workers deployed by WMSC and ANRUMC. In this regard, this Court does not find it necessary to delve into the factual circumstances and records of the case, given the consistent factual findings of the CA and the DOLE Secretary.

Notably, even with the same findings on questions of fact, the conclusion drawn by the CA differs from that of the DOLE Secretary on the question of whether members of petitioners should be deemed regular employees of respondents, by reason of the conclusive and binding effect that the CA ascribed in the NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case. Hence, while the CA opined in its Decision that the four-fold test for determining regular employment has been satisfied by the petitioners, it nonetheless held in the Amended Decision that no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties, echoing the NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case which already attained finality. This Court shall thus proceed to address such question of law posed by the present petition by discussing the legal ramifications, if any, as to the effect of the April 6, 2018 NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case, together with the September 16, 2020 Decision of this Court in the certification election case-both of which made independent albeit contrasting determinations on the existence of employer-employee relationship between the parties.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The October 12, 2020 Amended Decision and the October 26, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151257 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

" G.R. No. 269883, May 13, 2024","IN RE: PETITION FOR THE ALLOWANCE OF WILL PROVED OUTSIDE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATE UNDER RULE 77 OF THE RULES OF COURT,

ALLISON LYNN AKANA, PETITIONER.","Lynetta Jatico Sekiya (Lynetta) was an American citizen residing in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.[3] Lynetta died on February 13, 2017 in Honolulu and was survived by her husband, Stanley Tsugio Sekiya, and two daughters, Allison and Sheri-Ann Susana Chieko Matsuda.[4]

In Lynetta's last will and testament, she nominated Allison as her personal representative.[5] On September 17, 2019, Lynetta's last will and testament was informally admitted into probate by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of State of Hawaii.[6] Letters Testamentary was issued in favor of Allison on September 18, 2019.[7] This was renewed on October 14, 2022.[8]

Among the properties included in Lynetta's estate is a parcel of land located in Pardo, Cebu City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 110116[9] and Tax Declaration No. GRC6-12-079-00010.[10] In the tax declaration, it is indicated that the gross value of the property is PHP 896,000.00.[11]

Sometime in 2022, Allison filed a Petition for Allowance of Will Proved Outside the Philippines and Administration of Estate under Rule 77 of the Rules before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 11, Cebu City.[12] However, the MTCC dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The relevant portion of the MTCC Order states:
Considering that petitioner seeks for the recognition of the foreign court's judgment on probate, the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter. Under Rule 77 of the Rules of Court: wills proved and allowed in a foreign country, according to the laws of such country, may be allowed, filed, and recorded by the proper Court of First Instance in the (RTC) [sic] Philippines.

Accordingly, the case is dismissed without prejudice as to its filing to the proper court.",This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Orders[2] issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the Petition for Allowance of Will Proved Outside of the Philippines and Administration of Estate under Rule 77 of the Rules of Court filed by Allison Lynn Akana (Allison).,"The Petition is meritorious.

Direct recourse to this Court is proper considering that the present Petition raised a pure question of law


Preliminarily, this Court notes that from the dismissal of her petition by the trial court, Allison resorted to a direct appeal to this Court and bypassed the Court of Appeals. Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides the different modes of appeal from a decision of the RTC:
Section 2. Modes of appeal. —

(a)
Ordinary appeal. — The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where law on these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.

(b)
Petition for review. — The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall be by petition for review in accordance with Rule 42.


(c)
Appeal by certiorari. — In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with the Rule 45. (n)
We expounded on the foregoing in Heirs of Cabigas v. Limbaco:[24]
The first mode of appeal, the ordinary appeal under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the CA from the RTC, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, and resolves questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. The second mode of appeal, the petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the CA from the RTC, acting in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, and resolves questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. The third mode of appeal, the appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the Supreme Court and resolves only questions of law.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The Orders dated July 12, 2023 and August 14, 2023 issued by Branch 17, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City in SP. PROC. No. R-CEB-23-01374-SP are SET-ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to Branch 17, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City for further proceedings."
