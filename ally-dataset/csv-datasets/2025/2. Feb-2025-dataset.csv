Lizada et al. alleged that Spouses Cuizon were the registered owners of several parcels of land located in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu with a total area of 14,161.75 square meters.[4] On January 28, 1981, the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA)[5] sought the expropriation of said parcels of land for the development of an export processing zone in Lapu-Lapu City.[6] As such, Spouses Cuizon hired Atty. Tecson to represent them in the expropriation proceedings.[7]","This is an administrative Complaint[1] for disbarment filed against Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson (Atty. Tecson) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) due to his alleged failure to remit to the complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon (Lizada et al.) the total amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, representing half of the latter's just compensation.[2]","The Court adopts the findings and approves the recommendation of the IBP Board to disbar Atty.

"G.R. No. 255706, February 17, 2025","ROWENA MANLUTAC GREEN, PETITIONER, VS. JEFFERY A. GREEN AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
","Sometime in 2006, Jeffery, a United States Navy retiree, met Rowena in a bar owned by Rowena's mother in Angeles City, Pampanga.[7] Their friendship at the start later developed into a steady dating relationship.[8] At that time, Jeffery knew Rowena had two children from a previous relationship, and Rowena knew Jeffery was married to another, but that his divorce was still pending.[9]

On August 22, 2008, Rowena gave birth to her third child, Abigail.[10] Jeffery then acknowledged paternity of Abigail.[11] On May 8, 2010, Jeffery and Rowena got married at St. Ignatius de Loyola Cathedral in Quezon City.[12] After getting married, Jeffery stayed and worked in Makati City, while Rowena stayed with him three to four days a week and then returned to her children in Angeles City for the remaining days.[13]

On July 7, 2014, Jeffery filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[14] with Rowena before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, on the basis of both parties' psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. Aside from documentary evidence proving Rowena's infidelity, lies, and debts, Jeffery attached a Psychiatric Evaluation Report made by Dr. Ma. Bernadette Manalo-Arcena (Dr. Manalo-Arcena) after conducting interviews with Jeffery, Rowena, Rowena's mother, and the spouses' mutual friend. The Psychiatric Evaluation Report summarize factual bases for Jeffery's filing of the petition:

Rowena had more or else [sic] sustained debts worth [PHP] 4 million[]
DNA Test revealed that Jeffery Green is not the father of her daughter Abigail as she claimed however he accepted her as my [sic] own child
Jeffery Green saw pictures of his wife with another man hugging[,] holding hands and very close together
Lies with money relationship and activities
The house which he believed he invested was gone into waste as Rowena mishandled the money for the house
Rowena had 3 abortions and he found out she was using abortifacient medications
Dishonesty[,] lying[,] cheating and verbal abuse
Numerous debts and with pathological gambling
Falsification of their title of the house which he believed initially they owned and paid for but Rowena squandered his money.[15]","Psychological assessments based on testimonies of petitioner, respondent, respondent's mother, and the spouses' mutual friend may be given credence, unless there are reasons to believe that the testimonies are fabricated. As long as the totality of the evidence establishes petitioner's psychological incapacity, the declaration of nullity of marriage is warranted.[1]
This Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] assails the June 30, 2020 Decision[3] and January 29, 2021 Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the June 5, 2017 Decision[5] of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, declaring the marriage between Rowena Manlutac-Green (Rowena) and Jeffery A. Green (Jeffery)[6] as void ab initio on the ground of Rowena's psychological incapacity.","Here, this Court finds that Alfredo is psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, not because he suffers from schizophrenia per se, but because his psychosis has been found to be an enduring part of his personality structure. This psychosis, in tum, led him to do clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermined Irene and their family. As the lower courts found, Alfredo believes himself to be the son of God. In his mind, his refusal to live with Irene and to provide for the family was God's will. He also believes that he can have as many wives as he wants, which is not only illegal but is in utter disrespect and disregard of his marital vow to Irene. His incapacity is grave, not a ""mild characteriological peculiarity,"" a ""mood change,"" or an ""occasional emotional outburst""; his psychosis was grave enough for him to be discharged from military service.[55]

Similarly here, the totality of the evidence presented proved petitioner's psychological incapacity to comply with her marital obligations. Respondent discharged the burden of proof to establish the psychological incapacity with clear and convincing evidence. Aside from the Psychiatric Evaluation Report by Dr. Manalo-Arcena, respondent attached documentary evidence such as copies of collection cases filed against petitioner, the DNA test result on Abigail's paternity, and pictures of petitioner hugging and holding hands with another man,[56] in order to prove his allegation of petitioner's infidelity, lies, and debts. The Psychiatric Evaluation Report of the parties is further given probative value, since it was offered in evidence and the psychologist conducted a series of standard tests and interviewed petitioner, respondent, petitioner's mother, and the spouses' mutual friend.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The June 30, 2020 Decision and January 29, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109677 are AFFIRMED."
"A.C. No. 13361 [Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5314], February 12, 2025 ","HENRY G. LACIDA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REJOICE S. SUBEJANO, RESPONDENT.","On January 19, 2015, respondent and Mr. Alejandro Rentillosa (Rentillosa) applied for a loan amounting to PHP 15,000,000.00 with Megamitch to augment the capitalization of their aggregate business in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte.[2] At that time, Subejano & Ditucalan (SD Law), of which respondent is a founding partner, was Megamitch's retained legal counsel.[3] In securing the loan, respondent allegedly took advantage of his personal relationship with Megamitch's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alain De Schouwer (De Schouwer), and misrepresented that he and Mr. Rentillosa were engaged in the sand and gravel business in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte.[4]

Thus, on different dates in January 2015, De Schouwer authorized the release of funds totaling to PHP 11,679,900.00 to respondent, under a purported agreement that respondent would later execute a loan contract and provide the necessary security as required under Megamitch's loan application procedure.[5]",This resolves the complaint[1] for disbarment filed by complainant Henry G. Lacida (complainant) on behalf of Megamitch Financial Resources Corporation (Megamitch) against respondent Atty. Rejoice S. Subejano (respondent) in connection with a loan obtained by respondent from Megamitch.,"The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP-BOG to dismiss the complaint against respondent.

While it is clear that a lawyer-client relationship exists between respondent and Megamitch, there is no sufficient basis to hold respondent administratively liable for violating the prohibition on borrowing of money or property from clients.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds that there is no sufficient basis to hold Atty. Rejoice S. Subejano liable for violation of Canon III, Section 52 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Accordingly, the complaint is DISMISSED for lack of merit."

SACLUTI, GENER C. DIMARANAN, AND MARILYN M. BRUEL, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","In 2009, the United Boatmen Association of Pagsanjan (UBAP) filed a complaint for violation of Section 3(e), (g), (h), (i) and G) of Republic Act No. 3019 and Republic Act No. 9184[5] against Municipality of Pagsanjan, Laguna Mayor Estregan, Vice-Mayor Crisostomo B. Vilar (Vilar), Municipal Councilors Torres, Talabong, Rabago, Sacluti, Dimaranan, and Ronaldo C. Sablan (Sablan; accused public officials),[6] as well as private individual Bruel (collectively, accused-appellants) before the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), alleging that the accused public officials had unlawfully entered a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Accident Protection and Assistance (APA) with Bruel, proprietor of First Rapids Care Ventures (FRCV), without public bidding and despite the fact that FRCV holds no Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission.","This is an appeal[1] from the Sandiganbayan (SBN) Decision[2] convicting Jeorge Ejercito Estregan[3] (Estregan), Arlyn Lazaro-Torres (Torres), Terryl Gamit-Talabong (Talabong), Kalahi U. Rabago (Rabago), Erwin P. Sacluti (Sacluti), Gener C. Dimaranan (Dimaranan), and Marilyn M. Bruel (Bruel) of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.[4]","Seeking refuge in Our ruling in Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[31] Bruel posits that' if the assumption of risk and indemnification of loss are merely incidental to a business and service is the principal purpose, then it is not in the business of insurance. However, as previously discussed, the indemnification of loss is the principal object of the MOA. As testified by Estregan, he thought it was about time to have a specific program for tourists and boatmen since, on many occasions, freak accidents occurred and he had to personally shoulder the funeral services and repatriation of those who died.[32] If We were to believe his claim that he asked for and received offers from Philamlife and Oriental Insurance, which happen to be insurance companies, this would bolster the fact that indemnification was the principal object of the MOA while tourist protection through skills training and assistance for the boatmen was merely incidental. Moreover, in Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc., We cited American jurisprudence distinguishing medical service corporations from health and accident insurers in that the former undertake to provide prepaid medical services through participating physicians, thus relieving subscribers of any further financial burden, while the latter only undertake to indemnify an insured for medical expenses up to, but not beyond, the schedule of rates contained in the policy.[33]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The April 5, 2019 Decision and July 5, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0124 are AFFIRMED insofar as accused-appellants Jeorge Ejercito Estregan and Marilyn M. Bruel were found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e), Republic Act No. 3019 and were sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six years and one month as minimum to eight years as maximum with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. However, the same Decision and Resolution are MODIFIED in that accused-appellants Arlyn Lazaro-Torres, Terryl Gamit-Talabong, Kalahi U. Rabago, Erwin P. Sacluti, and Gener C.

SPOUSES OSCAR AND NORMA NUNEZ, THE CITY ASSESSOR OF QUEZON CITY, AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS.","This case stems from conflicting claims of ownership over a 243.50-square meter parcel of land with improvements located at No. 20, Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City (Corregidor Property).[5]

Spouses Conrado Nuñez, Sr. (Conrado, Sr.) and Maria Nuñez (Maria) had six children, namely: Conrado Nuñez, Jr. (Conrado, Jr.), Clarita Nuñez­ Abraham (Clarita), Celia Nuñez-Nuñez (Celia), Eduveges Nuñez-Alinea (Eduveges), Helen Nuñez-Quiozon (Helen), and Oscar Nuñez (Oscar).

Foremost, We emphasize that a petition for review on certiorari is a remedy under the law confined to settle questions of law and not questions of facts. However, the Court may take an exception thereto when the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court, as in this case.[69]

After a judicious review of the records, We find that petitioners failed to prove that the Corregidor Property was owned by their mother, Maria. Consequently, there is no basis for their claim that it is co-owned.

In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his or her case by preponderance of evidence. This is satisfied when the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to or has greater weight than that of the other.

"A.C. No. 13435 (Formerly CBD Case No. 18-5815), February 05, 2025","DENIS GUY MARTIN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LETICIA E. ALA, RESPONDENT.","Complainant, a French national, was married to respondent's sister, Rebecca E. Ala-Martin (Rebecca). In 1992, complainant and Rebecca separated legally. Thereafter, the couple filed cases against each other, with respondent representing her sister Rebecca.[2]

Sometime in 2006, complainant filed a Complaint for disbarment against respondent for allegedly representing conflicting interests and for using abusive and offensive language, titled Martin v. Atty. Ala and docketed as CBD Case No. 06-1846. The IBP Investigating Commissioner, as adopted and approved by the IBP Board of Governors, eventually found respondent administratively liable and, accordingly, recommended her suspension from the practice of law for two months. Respondent's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the IBP Board of Governors in a Resolution dated September 20, 2008.[3]

Thereafter, sometime in January 2017, respondent filed a Complaint for deportation (as Undesirable Alien) against complainant before the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Subsequently, on April 17, 2017, an apparent altercation occurred between respondent and complainant's son/respondent's nephew, Jean Marc. Because of these incidents, complainant filed the instant Complaint for disbarment against respondent.[4]

Particularly, complainant charged respondent with attempted murder and with violating the Lawyer's Oath, as well as Rules 1.01 and 1.02 of Canon 1 of the CPR for allegedly ordering the responding police officers during the incident on April 17, 2017 to shoot or kill Jean Marc, respondent's nephew. Complainant likewise charged respondent with violating Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the CPR for representing conflicting interests in connection with the deportation case she filed against the former. In this respect, complainant claimed that respondent used information previously obtained when she, through her law firm, was a counsel for the Drilling & Blasting Management Group, Inc., of which Rebecca was the President, albeit, complainant did not clarify his exact relation to the said company.[5] Finally, complainant asserted that respondent continues to use abusive and offensive language in her pleadings despite the previous sanction and warning given by the Court in A.C. No. 10556, in violation of Canon 8, Rule 8.01 of the CPR.[6]

In defense, respondent denied all the allegations against her and claimed that the previous case against her, A.C. No. 10556, is still pending before the Court.[7]","Before the Court is a Complaint[1] for disbarment filed on August 9, 2018 by complainant Denis Guy Martin (complainant) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Commission on Bar Discipline, accusing respondent Atty. Leticia E. Ala (respondent) of violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).","The Court resolves to adopt the findings and recommendation of the IBP, with modification as will be further discussed hereunder.

I

At the outset, it is important to note that on April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC or the ""Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability"" (CPRA), repealing the CPR, Sections 20 to 37 of Rule 138, and Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. Section 3 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall take effect fifteen (15) calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazette or any newspaper of general circulation."" The CPRA was published in the Philippine Star and Manila Bulletin on May 14, 2023 and hence, already effective on May 30, 2023.[17]

In this relation, Section 1 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the [Court], its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.""

In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of the CPRA, to the extent that it is applicable.

II

Time and again, the Court has emphasized that the practice of law is imbued with public interest and that a lawyer owes substantial duties, not only to their client, but also to their brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the public, and takes part in the administration of justice, one of the most important functions of the State, as an officer of the court. Accordingly, lawyers are bound to maintain, not only a high standard of legal proficiency, but also of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.[18]

Indeed, it is settled that the practice of law is not a right, but a privilege bestowed by the State on those who show that they possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications required by law for the conferment of such privilege. To this end, a member of the legal fraternity should refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession.[19] Accordingly, lawyers may be disciplined for any conduct, whether in their professional or in their private capacity, if such conduct renders them unfit to continue to be officers of the court.[20]

In this regard, Canon II of the CPRA requires lawyers to always act with propriety and maintain the appearance of propriety in personal and professional dealings, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession consistent with the highest standards of ethical behavior. It pertinently reads:","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Leticia E. Ala GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA). She is hereby meted with the following penalties, which shall be served successively, pursuant to Section 34(h) and (m), in relation to Sections 38, 39, and 40 of the CPRA:

(1)
SUSPENSION from the practice of law for six months for violating Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA; and


(2)
SUSPENSION from the practice of law for one year for violating Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA.
Further, she is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.

The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Atty. Leticia E. Ala is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that her suspension has started stating the exact date of receipt of this Decision, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where she has entered her appearance as counsel.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to Atty. Leticia E. Ala's personal record as an attorney, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all the courts.

After completing her suspension, Atty. Leticia E. Ala shall file with the Office of the Bar Confidant a Sworn Statement pursuant to Section 45 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability."
"G.R. No. 268979, February 05, 2025","JEFFREY ROSACAY EMPUERTO AND LEONIDO AND ROSALYN EMPUERTO, PETITIONERS, VS. SHEENA OLPOC CABRILLOS, RESPONDENT.","On February 26, 2013, Sheena Olpoc Cabrillos (Sheena) gave birth to Yuno Hanzo Cabrillos Empuerto (Yuno).[6] Jeffrey Rosacay Empuerto (Jeffrey) acknowledged being Yuno's father. He and Sheena lived in Davao City with his parents, spouses Leonido and Rosalyn Empuerto (Spouses Empuerto). Sometime in 2017, Sheena broke up with Jeffrey and left with Yuno to live with her parents in Cotabato City, where she enrolled Yuno to a local elementary school. Despite the distance, Jeffrey constantly communicated with Yuno and regularly had Yuno stay with him in Davao City for holidays and vacations.[7]

On March 13, 2020, Jeffrey brought Yuno back to Davao City for his summer vacation. Yuno' s stay was extended due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Sheena asked Jeffrey to bring Yuno back to her after the lockdown, but her plea was ignored. On July 6, 2020, Sheena went to Davao City to fetch Yuno, but Jeffrey and Spouses Empuerto (collectively, the Empuertos) refused to hand over the child.[8]

On August 6, 2020, with the assistance of police officers and a local social worker, Sheena tried to fetch Yuno again. Yuno refused to go with her.[9] Sheena requested assistance from the Office of the Punong Barangay, where she and Jeffrey agreed to turn over custody of Yuno at the end of his classes in April 2021.[10]

In April 2021, Jeffrey failed to give Yuno to Sheena, prompting her to file a police blotter of Jeffrey's failure to comply with the barangay agreement and a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus before the trial court.[11]

On May 3, 2021, the Regional Trial Court of Davao City issued a writ of habeas corpus requiring the Empuertos to appear and bring Yuno to court on May 5, 2021.[12]","Upon the return of the writ of habeas corpus, the trial court must determine rightful custody of the child and may issue a provisional order awarding custody of a minor in compliance with Sections 13 and 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors and Writ of Habeas Corpus in Relation to Custody of Minors.

Instantaneously.
