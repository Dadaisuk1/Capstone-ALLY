"G.R. No. 251903, January 27, 2025","VICTORIA M. LABASTIDA, PETITIONER, VS. MONINA C. QUIRES,** RESPONDENT","The instant case stemmed from an administrative complaint filed by respondent Monina C. Quires (Quires) for gross neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service against Labastida, who was then Municipal Planning and Development Officer (MPDO) of Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte.[6]

In the Complaint, Quires alleged that on July 3, 2013, then Municipal Mayor Napoleon Cuaton (Mayor Cuaton) directed Labastida to revise the local government unit's (LGU) Comprehensive Land Use Program (CLUP) to make it compliant with the guidelines set by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) on or before September 2013. Labastida undertook to submit the revision by September 12, 2013, yet, later on, requested for an extension until the end of October 2013. Despite her plea for an extension, she failed to submit the revised CLUP.[7] Subsequently, in February 2014, Labastida submitted the CLUP, which was found to be lacking in vital information, overall merit, and was alleged to contain ""copy-paste"" materials.[8] Despite follow-ups, Labastida failed to revise the CLUP.[9]

Quires further averred in her Complaint that Labastida is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for refusing to cooperate in the inquiry in aid of legislation conducted by Joel Cinco and submitting a Letter Reply that was disrespectful and arrogant. Furthermore, Labastida purportedly defied the directive of Mayor Cuaton to attend the training seminar workshop on March 20 to 22, 2014.[10] Moreover, Labastida allegedly posted comments on social media that embarrassed some LGU officials and employees[11] and acted dishonestly when she gave herself a high rating in her Performance Evaluation Report for the period of July to December 2013, sans sufficient basis and despite her failure to revise the CLUP.[12]

On June 18, 2015, the Disciplining Authority of the Office of the Municipal Mayor rendered a Decision[13] declaring Labastida liable for gross neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, thereby dismissing her. Labastida appealed the ruling before the CSC.

On March 14, 2016, the CSC rendered a Decision[14] granting the appeal. The CSC noted that there was no formal charge against Labastida.[15] Likewise, the CSC declared that Labastida's right to due process was violated because the Complaint did not contain a narration of the relevant and material facts that show the acts or omissions Labastida allegedly committed. The CSC further found that Labastida was not given the opportunity to file a comment or counter-affidavit to rebut the charges against her.[16] Accordingly, the CSC dismissed the Complaint without prejudice to its re-filing, and ordered the reinstatement of Labastida, with payment of backwages.[17]

On May 2, 2016, the Complaint against Labastida was re-filed.[18]

On June 10, 2016, the Disciplining Authority issued a Decision[19] holding Labastida liable for gross neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The Disciplining Authority opined that Labastida ignored the notices to attend the preliminary investigation and failed to submit her counter-affidavit to the charges. It thus meted the penalty of dismissal from the service against Labastida, with forfeiture of pension benefits and disqualification from holding any other public office, viz.:","On December 19, 2017, the CSC dismissed Labastida's appeal for having been filed out of time. It noted that a copy of the June 10, 2016 Decision was sent to Labastida through registered mail on June 14, 2016, as evidenced by Registry Return Receipt 506 194 569 ZZ. Labastida had 15 days therefrom to file her appeal, which she failed to do. Consequently, the CSC ruled as follows:

WHEREFORE, the Appeal of Victoria M. Labastida, Municipal Planning and Development Officer (MPDO), Municipality of Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte, is hereby DISMISSED. Accordingly, the Decision dated 10 June 2016 in Administrative Case No. 2016-01 issued by former Mayor Napoleon Cuaton, Office of the Municipal Mayor of Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte, finding her liable for the administrative offenses of Gross Neglect of Duty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meting upon her the penalty of dismissal from service with forfeiture of pension benefits and disqualification to hold any other public office, is hereby AFFIRMED.[23]","The petition is impressed with merit.

Prefatorily, the issue regarding the date of actual receipt of the June 10, 2016 Decision is a factual matter that generally may not be questioned through a petition for review on certiorari. It is doctrinally settled that this Court is not a trier of facts.[45] However, jurisprudence has carved an exception to the rule when the judgment is premised on a misapprehension of facts, as in the instant case.

Remarkably, the Constitution ordains that public office is a public trust. Public officers shall serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, and shall remain accountable to the people.[46] To ensure compliance with this Constitutional mandate, the CSC acts as the central personnel agency to enforce the laws and rules governing, among others, the discipline of civil servants.[47] On this score, Article IX-A, Section 6 of the Constitution vests the CSC with the power to promulgate its own rules concerning pleadings and practice before any of its offices. Likewise, Book V, Title I, Subtitle (A), Chapter 3, Section 12(2) of Executive Order No. 292 or the Administrative Code of 1987,[48] empowers the CSC to enforce rules to effectively carry out the procedure in administrative cases.[49] Pursuant thereto, the CSC adopted the RACCS to govern the conduct of proceedings m administrative cases or matters instituted before it, directly or on appeal.[50]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The April 10, 2019 Decision and the January 23, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB SP. No. 12157 affirming the December 19, 2017 and September 24, 2018 Orders of the Civil Service Commission, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is remanded to the Civil Service Commission which is DIRECTED to give due course to the appeal of Victoria M. Labastida for a proper resolution on the merits with dispatch."
"G.R. No. 273990, January 22, 2025","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant was charged with Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Republic Act No. 9208 based on the following Information,[8] to wit:
Criminal Case No. R-MNL-19-11384-CR

That [on] or about and during the period comprising from August 26, 2019 to September 5, 2019, inclusive, in the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, the said accused, for purposes of prostitution, pornography and sexual exploitation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly commit acts of trafficking in persons on the persons of [AAA] and [BBB],[9] both 14 year old minors, by then and there recruiting, obtaining, hiring, providing, transporting, maintaining and harboring them as MASSAGE THERAPIST of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx SPA, and for money considerations offering and delivering the said [AAA] and [BBB], to perform ""EXTRA SERVICE"" (MASSAGE WITH SEXUAL INTERCOURSE) to their customers.

That the crime was attended by the qualifying circumstances [sic] of minority, complainants [AAA] and [BBB], being 14 years of age.

Contrary to law.[10] (Emphasis in the original)
Upon her arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crime charged. After the termination of pre-trial, trial on the merits subsequently ensued.[11]","The CA rendered the assailed Decision[27] dated September 26, 2023, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED and the [May 19, 2021] Decision of the Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx, Branch 5 in Criminal Case No. R-MNL-19-11384-CR is MODIFIED in that appellant [XXX] is found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and pay a fine of [PHP 2,000,000.00]. Appellant [XXX] is also ordered to pay each of the victims moral damages in the amount of [PHP 500,000.00] and exemplary damages in the amount of [PHP 100,000.00]. Further, interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per anuum on all the damages awarded is hereby imposed reckoned from the date of finality of the Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[28] (Emphasis in the original)
In reviewing the case, the CA found no merit in accused-appellant's appeal. However, contrary to the RTC's findings, the CA concluded that the prosecution had successfully established the presence of all elements of Qualified Trafficking in Persons. The CA made the following findings: First, accused-appellant recruited AAA and BBB to work as massage therapists at a massage parlor in xxxxxxxxxxx. Second, the method of recruitment was deemed irrelevant, as it was established that AAA and BBB were minors at the time the crime was committed. Finally, the objective of the trafficking was clearly for sexual exploitation.

Hence, this appeal.[29]","The appeal is unmeritorious. The CA did not err in convicting accused-­appellant for the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.

Section 3 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, defines the term trafficking in persons. It states:
SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act:

(a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
In People v. Becaylas,[31] We held that Trafficking in Persons requires the following elements:
(1) The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (2) The means used which includes ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[32]
There are various ways through which the crime of human trafficking in persons can be perpetrated. These include the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transporting, transferring, maintaining, harboring, or receiving ""a person by any means . . . for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, [or] sexual exploitation[.]""[33]

However, paragraph 2, section 3 (a)[34] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 expressly provides an important distinction when it comes to minors. Specifically, the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered trafficking in persons, even if it does not involve any of the means stated under the law.[35] This distinction is crucial because, in the case of minors, even without the use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive means, a minor's consent is not considered to be given out of his or her own free will.[36] Furthermore, trafficking in persons may also be committed by taking advantage of a minor's vulnerability.[37]","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The September 26, 2023 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 46577 is AFFIRMED.

Accused-appellant XXX is found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4 (a), in relation to Section 6 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 and is sentenced to life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. She is further ordered to PAY AAA and BBB each PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

These monetary awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Resolution until fully paid."
"G.R. No. 269302, January 22, 2025","CAMPBRIDGE WATERPROOFING SYSTEMS, INC., REPRESENTED BY CAMPBRIDGE PAINTS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. GREENSEAL PRODUCTS [M] SDN. BHD.* AND GREENSEAL PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","In its Decision,[51] the CA granted the Petition for Review, and reinstated the Decision of the Director of IPOPHL-BLA that ordered the cancellation of Campbridge's trademark registration, thus:
WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 10, 2021 of Director General Rowel S. Barba of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines in Appeal No. 14-2019-0044 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In its stead, the July 17, 2019 Decision of Atty. Nathaniel S. Arevalo, affirming the May 21, 2018 Decision of Atty. Leonardo Oliver Limbo in IPC No. 14-2011-00100 for Cancellation of Trademark Registration No. 4-2009-001721, is REINSTATED.

SO ORDERED.[52]
The CA held that the rule conferring ownership of the marks through registration did not apply in cases where both conflicting marks have been used and/or registered prior to the effectivity of the Intellectual Property Code on January 1, 1998.[53] As the CA found Greenseal Malaysia's prior use of the mark since 1993,[54] it ruled that prior use is still the prevailing rule in determining ownership over a mark.[55]

Further, the CA pointed out that Greenseal obtained trademark registration of the mark ""GREENSEAL"" in 1993 in Malaysia, a member-state of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention), and as such, it enjoys protection under Section 3 of the Intellectual Property Code.[56] It found that Greenseal had an earlier filing date which prevents Campbridge from registering the mark to begin with.[57]

More, the CA found that Campbridge is prohibited from appropriating Greenseal's trade name as its mark.[58] Thus, it found that all the elements of trade name infringement were present.[59] Additionally, the CA found unmeritorious the argument of Campbridge that the name ""GREENSEAL"" is not Greenseal's trade name as it is not distinctive.[60]

Campbridge filed a Motion for Reconsideration,[61] which was denied by the CA in a Resolution.[62]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Campbridge Waterproofing Systems, Inc., represented by Campbridge Paints, Inc. (Campbridge) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA granted the Petition for Review[4] filed by Greenseal Products (M) Sdn. Bhd. (Greenseal Malaysia) and Greenseal Philippines Corporation (Greenseal Philippines) (collectively, Greenseal), reversing the Decision[5] of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines – Office of the Director General (IPOPHL-ODG).  Ultimately, the CA reinstated the Decision[6] of the Director of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines – Bureau of Legal Affairs (IPOPHL-BLA) which, in turn, affirmed the Decision[7] of the Adjudication Officer of the IPOPHL-BLA ordering the cancellation of Trademark Registration No. 4-2009-001721[8] for the mark ""GREENSEAL"" registered in the name of Campbridge.

Greenseal filed its Petition to [Cancel] Trademark Greenseal Registration No. 42009001721 dated May 4, 2009 (Petition for Cancellation)[9] with the IPOPHL-BLA, seeking cancellation of Trademark Registration No. 4-2009-001721 for ""GREENSEAL"" registered in the name of Campbridge for Class 17 of goods, namely, for elastomeric sealant.[10] Greenseal Malaysia claims to be the prior user of the mark, having adopted the ""GREENSEAL"" mark on March 27, 1986,[11] and has been issued a Certificate of Registration[12] issued by the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia for the mark ""GREENSEAL"" covering Class 17 goods starting from November 12, 1993.[13]
","The Petition is bereft of merit.

This dispute involves a petition for cancellation of the trademark ""GREENSEAL"" in the name of petitioner.

In Zulueta v. Cyma Greek Taverna Co.,[78] this Court summarized the definition, purpose, and functions of a trademark:
The IPC defines a ""mark"" as ""any visible sign capable of distinguishing the goods (trademark) or services (service mark) of an enterprise."" Verily, trademarks deal with the psychological function of symbols and the effect of these symbols on the public at large. It is a merchandising shortcut, and, whatever the means employed, the aim is the same—to convey through the mark, in the minds of potential customers, the desirability of the commodity upon which it appears. Thus, the protection of trademarks as intellectual property is intended not only to preserve the goodwill and reputation of the business established on the goods or services bearing the mark through actual use over a period of time, but also to safeguard the public as consumers against confusion on these goods or services. As viewed by modem authorities on trademark law, trademarks perform three (3) distinct functions: (1) they indicate origin or ownership of the articles to which they are attached; (2) they guarantee that those articles come up to a certain standard of quality; and (3) they advertise the articles they symbolize.[79] (Citation omitted)
The prevailing statement of how ownership of a trademark is acquired was formed in the case of Zuneca where this Court ruled that upon the enactment of the Intellectual Property Code, ownership over a trademark is acquired though registration, thus:
The current rule under the IP Code is thus in stark contrast to the rule on acquisition of ownership under the Trademark Law, as amended. To recall, the Trademark Law, as amended, provided that prior use and non­ abandonment of a mark by one person barred the future registration of an identical or a confusingly similar mark by a different proprietor when confusion or deception was likely. It also stated that one acquired ownership over a mark by actual use.

Once the IP Code took effect, however, the general rule on ownership was changed and repealed. At present, as expressed in the language of the provisions of the IP Code, prior use no longer determines the acquisition of ownership of a mark in light of the adoption of the rule that ownership of a mark is acquired through registration made validly in accordance with the provisions of the IP Code.[80] (Citations omitted)
Notwithstanding this declaration, this Court clarified that the certificate of registration remains only prima facie evidence of the validity of registration and the registrant's ownership of the mark, in recognition of instances when the certificate of registration does not reflect the true owner of the mark, such as, among others, when the registration was done in bad faith or contrary to law.[81]

Thus, in Medina v. Global Quest Ventures, Inc.,[82] this Court stated that while it is registration that vests ownership on a mark, pursuant to Section 151(b) of the Intellectual Property Code, registrations done in bad faith or contrary to the provisions of the Intellectual Property Code may still be a basis for the cancellation of a mark.[83]

More, in Zuneca, this Court confirmed that marks registered in bad faith or contrary to law should never have been registered in the first place, and as such, the registration is rendered void and shall be cancelled after proper proceedings.[84]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The January 30, 2023 Decision and the September 6, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 168609 are AFFIRMED. Trademark Registration No. 4-2009-001721 is CANCELLED. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Directors of the Bureau of Legal Affairs, Bureau of Trademarks, and the Library of the Documentation, Information and Technology Transfer Bureau of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines."
"G.R. No. 265808, January 22, 2025","LEONCIO L. MELOCOTON, PETITIONER, VS. JENNIFER B. PRING AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On April 9, 1981, Melocoton married Susan Jimenez (Jimenez) in San Pedro, Laguna.[5] On May 16, 1987, or during the subsistence of his marriage with Jimenez, Melocoton married Pring in Marbel, South Cotabato before the municipal mayor of Tantangan, South Cotabato.[6] In their Marriage Contract,[7] Melocoton and Pring were married at Pring's residence in Marbel, South Cotabato, solemnized by Liberato R. Deliza, Jr., municipal mayor of Tantangan, South Cotabato. Melocoton had real properties he owned in common with his siblings and a residential house in Melocoton compound, which was built using the money given by his mother.[8]

On September 6, 2005, Melocoton filed a Petition for Nullity of Marriage, Correction of Entries with Prayer of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory, and Prohibitory Injunction[9] against Pring before the RTC contending that his marriage with Pring. was null and void because he was already married to Jimenez, the solemnizing officer, who officiated his wedding with Pring had no legal authority to solemnize the marriage, and his signature in the marriage certificate of his second marriage was forged.[10] Additionally, Melocoton claimed that the real properties belong to him exclusively, and sought to have the entries in the certificates of title of the subject properties naming Pring as his wife, be stricken off from the titles.[11]

For her part, Pring contended that she believed in good faith that the mayor of Tantangan, South Cotabato had the legal authority to solemnize her marriage with Melocoton. Nevertheless, in the event that her marriage with Melocoton be declared void, their property relations should be governed by Article 147 of the Family Code, which provides for a presumption of joint contribution, and thus, they have equal shares of the properties acquired during their marriage. She further argued that she contributed to the residential house by funding its completion with her own money, including the appliances, furniture, and fixtures.[12]","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Leoncio L. Melocoton (Melocoton) assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding the marriage of Melocoton and respondent Jennifer B. Pring (Pring) is not bigamous.","The Petition is unmeritorious.

Generally, only matters assigned as errors in the appeal may be resolved by the CA. As an exception, the CA may review errors that are not assigned but are closely related to or dependent on an assigned error. Rule 51, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides:

In Catholic Bishop of Balanga v. CA,[23] this Court enumerated the exceptions where the CA may review errors that are not assigned before it, thus:
True, the appealing party is legally required to indicate in his brief an assignment of errors, and only those assigned shall be considered by the appellate court in deciding the case.

He belonged to the same class with Noel Fernandez (Noel) and Mark Dy (Mark).[5]

On January 19, 2007, Noel lost his mechanical pencil during Music class. Rhys found Noel's pencil and brought it home. Few days after, Noel noticed that Rhys was using his mechanical pencil during Filipino class. He then informed Rhys that the pencil belonged to him. Nevertheless, Noel allowed Rhys to use the pencil because Rhys had no pencil at that time. However, Rhys forgot to return the pencil at the end of the day.[6]

On January 26, 2007, during Computer class, Noel asked Rhys to return his pencil. However, Rhys told him that he did not bring the pencil and will return it next time. Rhys was seated beside Mark and Noel. After a while, Mark suddenly punched Rhys's left arm three times, Noel followed up with two more punches, then Mark for another three punches, and Noel for another three punches. In total, Rhys was punched six times by Mark and five times by Noel. Mr. Gerald Gomez (Gomez), the teacher at that time, was in the comfort room during the incident.[7]

On January 29, 2007, Rhys reported the incident to his Hekasi teacher, Mr. Mark Anthony Gallardo (Gallardo). Rhys told him ""Teacher sinuntok nila ako,""[8] but Mr. Gallardo did nothing on the matter.[9]

On February 1, 2007, one of Rhys's classmates saw his bruises and reported the matter to their class adviser, a certain teacher named Cecil. Teacher Cecil asked Rhys as to what happened. Then, Teacher Cecil called Noel and Mark who admitted punching Rhys.[10]

The afternoon of the same day, Gloria Fernandez (Gloria), Noel's mother, called Villa Palaganas (Villa), Rhys's mother, and asked for an apology.

"G.R. No. 260415, January 15, 2025","PUNONG BARANGAY DANTE PADAYAO, PETITIONER, VS. GOV. LUIS RAYMUND F. VILLAFUERTE, JR., ATTY. JANIS IAN REGASPI-CLEOFE, JOSE FRANCISCO L. MUSA, JR., LUIS ZULUETA, JOVIE VILLAREAL, DONDON OBIAS AND THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF CAMARINES SUR, AS WELL AS EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL AND/OR INDIVIDUALS, WHETHER CLAIMING, USING AND/OR EXERCISING RIGHTS UNDER THEM, RESPONDENTS.","The subject of this case is Pitogo Island, Caramoan, Camarines Sur, consisting of Lot Nos. 6972 and 6973. Lot No. 6973 is covered by Katibayan ng Orihinal na Titulo Bilang 35669[6] (KOT Blg. 35669) issued in the name of the Heirs of Mario Padayao (Mario), represented by Dante, and has a total area of 74,407 square meters.[7]

In a Letter[8] dated January 6, 2009, the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur (Provincial Government), through its co-respondent Atty. Janis Ian Regaspi-Cleofe (Atty. Cleofe), informed Rowel Padayao[9] and other residents of Pitogo Island that they must vacate it within 10 days from receipt of the letter because it is considered a protected area and is part of the danger zone.[10]

On January 20, 2009, armed men, together with respondents Luis Zulueta, Jovie Villareal (Villareal), and Dondon Obias, went to Pitogo Island and informed its residents that they must vacate the island; otherwise, their structures will be demolished. The incident was recorded in a blotter report[11] made by Dante at the Caramoan Municipal Police Station.[12]

In a Letter[13] dated February 2, 2009 to Atty. Cleofe, Atty. Thomas C. Uy, Jr., the counsel of the Padayaos, asserted that Pitogo Island is covered by Free Patent No. 18000 issued in favor of Julio Padayao (Julio), son of Mario Padayao, who has been occupying Pitogo Island since 1931 in the concept of an owner and whose possession has been public, open, continuous, exclusive, notorious, and adverse. Unfortunately, Free Patent No. 18000 was lost during World War II and is beyond recovery, as evidenced by the Certification[14] from the Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur stating that all Registry documents and records were burned during the June 26, 1976[15] fire that razed the Provincial Capitol in Naga City.

On February 4, 2009, the Provincial Government, through respondent Jose Francisco L. Musa, Jr. (Musa) and Villareal, together with armed men, demolished the structures in Pitogo Island, including that of Dante's.[16]

This led Dante to file a Complaint[17] for recovery of possession and damages with application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction against respondents before the RTC","Before the Court is an Appeal by Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Punong Barangay Dante Padayao (Dante) assailing the Decision[2] dated May 25, 2021, and Resolution[3] dated April 22, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112165. The CA affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated April 27, 2018, and Order[5] dated September 25, 2018, of Branch 30, Regional Trial Court (RTC), San Jose, Camarines Sur in Civil Case No. T-1133.","The Court grants the petition. 
 
Jurisdiction over the case remains with the RTC
 

Preliminarily, the Court notes that Dante filed the Complaint with the RTC to recover possession of Lot Nos. 6972 and 6973 within a period of one year from the time that he was forcibly evicted therefrom.

Relevantly, it is a cardinal rule that the jurisdiction of the court and the nature of the action are determined based on the allegations in the complaint. Dante expressly stated in his Complaint that it is in the nature of an accion publiciana.[45] An accion publiciana is the ""plenary action to recover the better right of possession (possession de jure), which should be brought in the proper inferior court or Regional Trial Court (depending upon the value of the property) when the dispossession has lasted for more than one year (or for less than a year in cases other than those mentioned in Rule 70 of the Rules of Court).""[46]

Notwithstanding the statement of Dante, his Complaint was filed on January 20, 2010,[47] or within one year from the date of loss of possession on February 4, 2009, when the demolition took place.[48] Even if it is counted from the time that the letter of Atty. Cleofe was delivered, or on January 20, 2009,[49] this still falls within the period of one year. Clearly then, the dispossession has not exceeded one year at the time of the filing of the complaint.

In addition, the Complaint provides:
8.0. On 4th of February 2009, to plaintiff's [Dante] surprise and consternation, as well as his immediate family members, relatives and constituents residing thereat, several unidentified heavily armed men comprising of more or less 20 in strength asserting themselves as belonging to Civil Security Unit headed by defendant [Musa], acting under the direct instructions and express orders of the Acting Chief Provincial Legal Officer, arriving thereat with drawn firearms and thereupon commanded all of them right away to get out, vacate their respective residential dwellings, herded them at a nearby distance and did there and then, by means of force, violence, coercion and intimidation, without showing them any demolition or eviction order or proper authority of law whatsoever, instantaneously carried out and commenced with the illegal and arbitrary demolition of their residential houses afore-described and other existing structures erected thereat and thereafter threatened and compelled them against their will to sign certain documents without giving them a chance to at least read or peruse the same, refusing to give them any copy thereof despite their insistence...[50]
The foregoing allegation qualifies for forcible entry under Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, which applies when the complainant is deprived of physical possession of his land or building by means of force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth.[51]

Further, the assessed value of the property is a jurisdictional element to determine the court that can take cognizance of an action involving title to or possession of real property.[52] As a rule, jurisdiction is determined based on the assessed value of the real property as alleged in the complaint.[53] If the assessed value is not stated in the complaint, it may still be identified through ""a facial examination of the documents already attached to the complaint.""","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated May 25, 2021 and Resolution dated April 22, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112165 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that respondents Gov. Luis Raymund F.

"G.R. No. 240143, January 15, 2025","STEPHANIE A. MAITIM, MARGIE M. AMBAN, AND FLORA Q. MAHINAY, PETITIONERS, VS. TEKNIKA SKILLS AND TRADE SERVICES, INC./CESAR E. PABELLANO AND ARABIAN GULF COMPANY FOR MAINTENANCE AND CONTRACTING,**** RESPONDENTS.","On different dates in the year 2013, Maitim et al. were hired by TSTSI, on behalf of its principal, AGCMC, for the position of Nursing Aide at King Fahad General Hospital in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.[7]

Maitim et al. claimed that when they were hired by TSTSI, their respective employment contracts provided that, for a period of two years, they would work eight hours a day and receive a monthly salary of USD 400.00. In addition, Maitim et al. alleged that their original contract, copies of which were never given to them by TSTSI, provided that they were entitled to a food allowance and an annual vacation leave of 21 days with full pay. These are reflected in the records of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)[8] and, more importantly, in the Standard Employment Contract for Various Skills.[9]

However, on the day of their respective departures to Saudi Arabia, Maitim et al. were each required to sign a second contract of employment designating them as housekeepers and, for a period of three years, work 12 hours a day with a much lower monthly salary of SAR 8.50.00. Maitim et al. protested but they were allegedly blackmailed by TSTSI's representative that, in addition to reimbursing all of the agency's expenses, they would have to pay hefty fines for backing out. Thus, Maitim et al. were constrained to sign the second contract and go to Saudi Arabia.[10]
 
Maitim et al. claimed that even after their contracts had ended, AGCMC refused to allow them to retun1to the Philippines. It was only after they sought help from the local police that AGCMC allowed them to leave. In view of AGCMC's acts, Maitim and Mahinay worked with them for three years and two months while Amban worked for three years and eight months, more or less.[11]

Maitim et al. were repatriated sometime in October 2016. Afterwards, they instituted the instant case with the arbitration branch of the NLRC.[12]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, assailing the Decision[2] dated February 28, 2018 and the Resolution[3] dated June 11, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 153484.

The assailed issuances annulled and set aside the Decision[4] dated August 29, 2017 and the Resolution[5] dated October 25, 2017 issued by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. (OFW) 03-000241-17 which, in turn, affirmed with modification the January 30, 2017 Decision[6] of Labor Arbiter Michelle P. Pagtalunan (LA Pagtalunan) in NLRC-NCR Case No. (L) 11-14779-16.

In her Decision, LA Pagtalunan partly found merit in the complaint for underpayment of wages, nonpayment of overtime pay, vacation leave pay, food allowance and other monetary claims filed by petitioners Stephanie A. Maitim (Maitim), Margie M. Amban (Amban), and Flora Q. Mahinay (Mahinay) (Maitim, et al.) against respondents Teknika Skills and Trade Services, Inc. (TSTSI), TSTSI's President, Cesar E. Pabellano (Pabellano), and Arabian Gulf Company for Maintenance and Contracting (AGCMC) (TSTSI, et al.).","The petition is impressed with merit.

I.

Rule IV, Section 5(c)[61] of the 2009 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals states that the provisions of Rule 46, as far as applicable, and Rule 65 shall govern petitions for certiorari which are filed before the CA.

In relation thereto, Rule 65, Section 6 of the Rules of Court provides the instances when the CA may order a respondent to a petition for certiorari to comment thereto:
SECTION 6. Order to comment. — If the petition is sufficient in form and substance to justify such process, the court shall issue an order requiring the respondent or respondents to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy thereof. Such order shall be served on the respondents in such manner as the court may direct together with a copy of the petition and any annexes thereto.

In petitions for certiorari before the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Section 2, Rule 56, shall be observed. Before giving due course thereto, the court may require the respondents to file their comment to, and not a motion to dismiss, the petition. Thereafter, the court may require the filing of a reply and such other responsive or other pleadings as it may deem necessary and proper. (Emphasis supplied)
The use of the word ""may"" conveys that it is discretionary upon the CA to require any comment from the respondent in a petition for certiorari. In this case, the CA exercised this discretion when it issued a Minute Resolution[62] dated February 2, 2018 providing, among others that:
Without necessarily giving due course to the petition for certiorari, private respondents are required to file comment [sic] thereon (not a motion to dismiss) within 10 days from notice. Petitioners may file a reply within five (5) days from receipt of the comment.[63]
However, the CA did not await Maitim et al.'s comment. In fact, it never even verified the date when Maitim et al. received its Minute Resolution. The CA rushed, without any plausible reason, the issuance of the herein assailed Decision. Understandably, Maitim et al. were confused because the said Decision was promulgated even before they received their copy of the CA's Minute Resolution.

At any rate, the Court does not agree with the CA's assessment that Maitim et al.'s Motion for Reconsideration, to Inhibit and to Reraffle[64] is a pro forma motion.

A motion for reconsideration is filed to convince a court that its ruling is erroneous and improper, contrary to the law or the evidence, thus affording the said court ample opportunity to rectify the same.[65] On the other hand, a pro forma motion is intended to delay or impede the progress of proceedings.[66]

Here, Maitim et al.'s motion was filed precisely to inform the CA that its ruling was improper because it hastily issued its Decision without even awaiting for them to file their comment within the period that was provided by the CA itself. It was filed to address the complete deprivation of due process that the CA committed against them. As the Court pronounced in Marina Properties Corporation v. Court of Appeals:[67]
Where the circumstances of a case do not show an intent on the part of the pleader to merely delay the proceedings, and his motion reveals a bona fide effort to present additional matters or to reiterate his arguments in a different light, the courts should be slow to declare the same outright as pro forma. The doctrine relating to pro forma motions has a direct bearing upon the movant's valuable right to appeal. It would be in the interest of justice to accord the appellate court the opportunity to review the decision of the trial court on the merits than to abort the appeal by declaring the motion pro forma, such that the period to appeal was not interrupted and had consequently lapsed.[68]
Accordingly, Maitim et al.'s motion is not pro forma. The Court rejects TSTSI et al.'s assertion that Maitim et al.'s right to seek judicial relief had already lapsed. The CA improvidently ordered the issuance of an entry of judgment against Maitim et al. Accordingly, the Court shall discuss the merits of the instant petition.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

GOÑO, RESPONDENTS.","On January 3, 2012, spouses Goño filed with the Regional Trial Court of Nasugbu, Batangas a complaint for abatement of nuisance, easement, and injunction against spouses Calimlim.

Spouses Goño alleged that they are the owners and operators of Villa Alexandra Beach Resort and Restaurant (Villa Alexandra) situated in Barangay Matabungkay, Lian, Batangas.[4] On the other hand, spouses Calimlim operated informal structures and rest houses[5] along the shore of Matabungkay Beach and provided video machines, videoke sets, and billiard tables with assortment of sari-sari stores and carinderias to tourists.[6] By reason of the discomfort and inconvenience caused by spouses Calimlim's aforesaid activities, their resort and restaurant guests complained and swore never to return to Villa Alexandra. Some guests even left to stay in another establishment.[7]

The structures constructed by spouses Calimlim obstructed the view of Villa Alexandra on the shore of Matabungkay Beach.[8] These structures stood on a piece of land declared as a tourist zone and maritime reserve of the sea under Proclamation No. 1801 dated November 10, 1978. Spouses Goño learned that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) denied spouses Calimlim's application for a foreshore lease. Too, spouses Calimlim did not secure the necessary permits, e.g., building permit, business permit, sanitary permit, and mayor's permit, from the proper authorities for their business; nor did spouses Calimlim issue the corresponding official receipts or pay taxes on their business.[9] Spouses Calimlim's operations produced excessive noise, offensive odor, and made the water coming from their toilets seep into the ground and in the open dining area of Villa Alexandra. Spouses Calimlim also failed to dispose of human excrement in a sanitary manner but in a way that is nauseating and repulsive to the guests of Villa Alexandra.[10] They maintained open-fire kitchens where their guests could cook on makeshift stoves. On June 15, 2009, spouses Goño heard an explosion which resulted in a fire in the main electrical line of Rufina Cabral (Rufina). The fire was not put out until respondent Efren brought a fire extinguisher from Villa Alexandra to quell the flames.[11]
","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 116735:

Goño (Efren) and Rafaelita R. Goño's (Rafaelita; collectively referred to as spouses Goño) complaint for abatement of nuisance, easement, and injunction against spouses Pablo Calimlim and Patnubay Isla Calimlim (spouses Calimlim), substituted by Bienvenido Calimlim and Rufina Cabral; and

Resolution[3] dated February 1, 2024, denying spouses Calimlim's motion for reconsideration.","Foremost, a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 generally requires that only questions of law be raised in the petition, since factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari.[43] This rule, however, is subject to exceptions, which include cases where the findings of the lower courts are conflicting.[44] Such is the case here.

Anent the alleged violation of the Judicial Affidavit Rule, We find no error in the trial court's admission of exhibits identified by Rafaelita. As held by the Court of Appeals, Rafaelita took pains in her judicial affidavit to identify each of the exhibits attached to the same.[45] As quoted by spouses Calimlim themselves in their Petition,[46] during the hearing of the case, she took the stand and confirmed that she did, in fact, execute a judicial affidavit dated November 6, 2014. She also affirmed the contents and facts stated therein, including her identification of the exhibits admitted by the trial court. Considering that the very purpose of the judicial affidavit is for such affidavit to take the place of the direct testimony of the witness,[47] and that Rafaelita herself affirmed the contents of her judicial affidavit in open court, there was no violation of the Judicial Affidavit Rule as to otherwise warrant the exclusion of the evidence already admitted by the trial court. Additionally, the Court notes that spouses Calimlim only raised this supposed error before the Court of Appeals. The records and even spouses Calimlim's account do not show that they objected to the admission of exhibits identified by Rafaelita. Basic is the rule that grounds for objections not raised at the proper time shall be considered waived.[48] Consequently, the Court of Appeals may not consider any other ground of objection apart from those that were raised at the proper time.[49] Assuming, therefore, that these exhibits were not duly authenticated, this objection is deemed waived due to spouses Calimlim's failure to timely object to their admission.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Decision dated September 13, 2023 and Resolution dated February 1, 2024 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 116735 are AFFIRMED."

That sometime in the month of November 2007, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the said accused, conniving and confederating together and mutually helping each other, with deliberate intent, with intent to gain did then and there engaged in recruitment and placement activities of workers for overseas employment, without previously obtaining a license therefor from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), recruiting Medged C.

Albert Buit (Alberto) and Tessie Granada Sta. Agata-Buit (Tessie; collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal recruitment, as defined and penalized under Sections 6, in relation to Section 7(a), of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8042, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended by R.A No. 10022.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

Prefatorily, the Court notes that accused-appellants elevated the matter before the Court through an ordinary appeal. As a rule, appeals of criminal cases shall be brought to the Court by filing a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, and as an exception, an appeal on the CA's decision shall be made by a mere notice of appeal in cases wherein the CA imposed the penalty of death, reclusion perpetua, life imprisonment or where a lesser penalty is imposed but for offenses committed on the same occasion or which arose out of the same occurrence that gave rise to the more serious offense for which the penalty of death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment is imposed.""[13] In this case, accused-appellants clearly availed of a wrong mode of appeal by filing a notice of appeal despite having been merely sentenced by the courts a quo to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for six years and one day, as minimum, to eight years, as maximum. This notwithstanding and further considering that this case involves the liberty of accused-appellants, the Court shall resolve the substantive matter at hand.

After a judicial perusal of the records, the Court is convinced that accused-appellants' conviction for simple illegal recruitment must be sustained, as will be explained hereunder.

Article 13(b) of the Labor Code enumerates the acts that constitute recruitment and placement, thus:
(b) ""Recruitment and placement"" refer to any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring worker, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided That any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.
R.A. No. 8042, as amended by R.A. No. 10022, expanded the coverage of acts classified as illegal recruitment under the Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines.[14] Section 6 thereof defined illegal recruitment as:
SECTION 6. Definition. — For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines[.] (Emphasis supplied)
Consequently, under Article 13(f) of the Labor Code, ""authority"" is defined as a document issued by the Department of Labor authorizing a person or association to engage in recruitment and placement activities as a private recruitment entity.

To sustain a conviction for illegal recruitment, the following elements must concur: (a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable one to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers; and (b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of recruitment and placement defined in Article 13(b)[15] of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Section 6 of R.A. No. 8042.[16] Verily, it is the absence of the necessary license or authority to recruit and deploy workers abroad that renders the recruitment activity unlawful.[17]

As correctly found by the courts a quo, the prosecution was able to successfully establish the elements of illegal recruitment.","FOR THESE REASONS, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated November 28, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 01699 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellants Alberto V. Buit Fe a.k.a. Alberto Buit and Tessie Granada Sta. Agata-Buit are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of simple illegal recruitment, as defined and penalized under Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act No. 8042, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended by Republic Act No. 10022. Accordingly, they are each sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of 10 years and one day, as minimum, to 12 years, as maximum, and they are ordered to PAY a fine in the amount of PHP 500,000.00 each. Moreover, they are ordered to refund to private complainant Medged C. Baguio the amount of PHP 3,000.00, representing the reservation fee the latter paid to them. In addition, a legal interest at.6% per annum shall be imposed on the refund from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

(MaxBank) (a) has insufficient realizable assets, as determined by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), to meet its liabilities; and (b) cannot continue in business without involving probable losses to its depositors and creditors, as evidenced by the Bank's (i) negative capital adequacy ratio (CAR), negative adjusted capital, and chronic capital deficiencies; (ii) chronic net losses and poor operating performance; (iii) Prompt Corrective Action status and non-compliance with the Monetary Board directives therein: and (iv) Board of Directors (BOD) and Management's failure to effectively manage and oversee the affairs and operations of the Bank resulting in the violation of the BSP regulation on servicing deposits outside bank premises and commission of unsafe or unsound banking leading to net losses and dissipation of assets, and that based on the existing circumstances and conditions evaluated by FSD VIII and FSID, the losses will continue and it is unlikely that losses will be reversed, which are grounds for prohibiting the Bank from doing business in the Philippines under Section 30 (b) and (c) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act). as amended; and considering that the Bank's BOD/Management/Stockholders failed to (i) prove that the P300 million funds infused came from the third party investors approved by BSP namely. Unicorn Wing Investments Limited, Century Merit Global Limited, and DLO Holdings (Philippines), Inc. on a 40%-20%-40% basis; (ii) abide by their undertaking to cause the infusion of capital to meet the minimum requirements; (iii) restore the Bank's financial health and viability and address its financial and operational problems; (iv) comply with the commitments in the Memorandum of Understanding; (v) reverse the Bank's chronic losses, negative adjusted capital, negative CAR, and negative net realizable value of assets; and (vi) address the violation of the BSP regulation on servicing deposit outside banking premises and commission of unsafe or unsound banking leading to dissipation of asserts, and considering further that the Bank had been accorded due process, the Board approved the joint recommendation of FSD VIII and FSID, endorsing as follows:[134]
The action of the Monetary Board in closing a bank is final and executory and may only be set aside if found to be in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion as to amount to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[135] In Apex Bancrights Holdings, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,[136] the Court held that the Monetary Board's issuance of a resolution liquidating Export and Industry Bank (EIB) cannot be tainted with grave abuse of discretion since it was amply supported by the factual circumstances and was in accordance with prevailing law and jurisprudence:
[T]he Monetary Board's issuance of Resolution No. 571 ordering the liquidation of EIB cannot be considered to be tainted with grave abuse of discretion as it was amply supported by the factual circumstances at hand and made in accordance with prevailing law and jurisprudence. To note, the ""actions of the Monetary Board in proceedings on insolvency are explicitly declared by law to be 'final and executory.' They may not be set aside, or restrained, or enjoined by the courts, except upon 'convincing proof that the action is plainly arbitrary and made in bad faith,'"" which is absent in this case.[137]
Under Section 30 of Republic Act No. 7653, only a ""report of the head of the supervising or examining department"" of the BSP is necessary for the Monetary Board to forbid the institution from doing business in the Philippines.[138] BSP, the umbrella agency of the Monetary Board, in its capacity as government regulator of banks, and the PDIC, as statutory receiver of banks under Republic Act No. 7653, are the principal agencies mandated by law to determine the financial viability of banks, and to facilitate the receivership and liquidation of closed financial institutions.[139]

Like any administrative body, the Monetary Board and the BSP, in concluding that there were grounds for bank closure, should only have sufficient basis. Furthermore, their findings of fact must be supported by substantial evidence, thus:
Needless to say, the decision of the MB and BSP, like any other administrative body, must have something to support itself and its findings or fact must be supported by substantial evidence. But it is clear under RA 7653 that the basis need not arise from an examination as required in the old law.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The September 3, 2020 Decision and November 24, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 164310 are AFFIRMED.
