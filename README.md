ALLY is a digital platform designed to streamline and secure the process of finding legal assistance and managing initial legal interactions. It connects clients with legal professionals, facilitates preliminary consultations, and organizes virtual legal processes, aiming to make legal services more accessible, efficient, and secure.

Built with a modern technology stack, ALLY leverages **Spring Boot** for a robust backend and **Kotlin** for native Android mobile support, providing a seamless experience for users on the go.

## ✨ Features

ALLY offers a suite of features designed to improve the legal engagement process:

* **🧠 Client-Lawyer Matching:** An intelligent system that uses AI to connect clients with the most suitable lawyers based on specialization, location, and availability. Lawyers benefit from a dedicated dashboard to manage their profiles and appointments.
* **🗂 Virtual Legal Process Organization:** Provides a secure, centralized repository for document uploads and management, significantly reducing reliance on physical paperwork and improving accessibility.
* **🤖 Preliminary AI Consultation:** An AI-powered tool that assesses case viability based on historical data and legal knowledge, offering preliminary insights, suggesting potential strategies, and outlining legal options.
* **💬 On-the-Spot Online Consultations:** A temporary, real-time chat system for clients to ask quick legal queries and receive immediate preliminary advice. Designed with privacy in mind, messages are not stored long-term.
* **📈 Case Tracking and Updates:** Keeps clients informed with automated email notifications on case progress. A unique case tracking ID allows clients to independently check their case status on the platform.
* **📚 Educational Resources:** Offers a wealth of legal guides, FAQs, and document templates accessible offline, empowering clients with basic legal knowledge.
* **🔐 Security and Privacy:** Ensures the highest level of security with end-to-end encryption for all communications and data. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection for user accounts.
